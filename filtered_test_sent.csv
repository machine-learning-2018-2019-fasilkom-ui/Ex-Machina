3,5.0,"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.",positive,"I 100 happy purchase. I caught sale really good price. I normally real book person, I 1 year old loves ripping pages.

186,5.0,"When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7"" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the ""Front Porch"", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!",positive,"When I first read Amazon Echo Show, I thought sound quality would inferior Echo small size, would deal breaker.

247,4.0,"If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyoneÄôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you arenÄôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you donÄôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.",positive,"If looking something help keep organized keep date weather, markets, latest news Amazon Echo Show looking for.

I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen, and most of them have been very helpful.

302,5.0,"Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is ""show"", so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do ""drop in"", which is essentially visual phone calls. It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.",positive,"Despite less friendly price point (if get sale), Amazon item well designed delivers promises hype product description.

304,4.0,"The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as ""play"" or ""start"" or ""open"") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don't really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like. I don't see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading.",positive,"The Alexa Show purchased replace another much older device Show good device lacking aspects I older device.

305,5.0,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",positive,"Alexa Show really well put together.

Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book.

The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for.

I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo.

677,4.0,"I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item.

Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.",positive,"So added Echo family devices. It's nice screen, I honestly find I use much I thought I would.

750,5.0,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",positive,"Alexa Show really well put together.

780,5.0,"So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However, this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it.

My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.",positive,"I bought son product times takes easily electronics touch screen devices.

2364,4.0,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",positive,"I've lots tablets past, mostly Samsung line, first Amazon Fire, I want write review others never tried one these.

2384,5.0,"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!",positive,"OK, I unsure Kindle bells whistles others. BUT I happy it. I love Kindle!

3111,5.0,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",positive,"Full disclosure.

3173,4.0,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",positive,"I bought I bought Amazon Echo.

3218,5.0,"Even when IÄôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book IÄôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isnÄôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes IÄôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes IÄôm sitting down. No matter what IÄôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it wonÄôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they donÄôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I donÄôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second IÄôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I donÄôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isnÄôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They arenÄôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they wonÄôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldnÄôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",positive,"Even IÄôm outside bright sunlight, words book IÄôm reading still crystal clear.

We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience.

3287,5.0,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",positive,"Its great ereader little pricy. It specs Voyage far pixels procesor, costs less.

3313,5.0,"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.",positive,"When first announced Kindle Oasis, I much desire upgrade 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite.

They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does.

3341,5.0,"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing.

3344,4.0,"I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.",positive,"I old Kindle Touch, last one still text-to-voice, longer works.

This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight.

3729,5.0,"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!",positive,"For tablet extremely good value! iPads beautiful things, seem work really well time. But expensive! Same thing Android tablets.

3842,4.0,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable.

There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,positive,Great price 89 dollars great tablet. It fast everything accept game play. For example plays asphalt 8 game barely playable.

The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2.

The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",positive,"Purchased child's tablet I happier!

The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it!

4771,5.0,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed.

They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does.

4777,5.0,"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",positive,"Despite able get one Amazon late June due apparent strong demand, Best Buy able get one day release, April 27.

That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isnÄôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes IÄôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes IÄôm sitting down. No matter what IÄôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it wonÄôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they donÄôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I donÄôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second IÄôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I donÄôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isnÄôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They arenÄôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they wonÄôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldnÄôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",positive,"Even IÄôm outside bright sunlight, words book IÄôm reading still crystal clear.

4782,5.0,"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",positive,"With cover attached, battery lasts good, long period.

4870,5.0,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",positive,"For price excellent tablet. I high end laptop convert tablet almost 16"" foldover design I normally use laptop mode.

4871,4.0,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",positive,"I've lots tablets past, mostly Samsung line, first Amazon Fire, I want write review others never tried one these.

5027,5.0,"I bought this on impulse because I had heard great things about it. I have a variety of automated home devices, such as Philips Hue bulbs, and wanted to see if the Echo would help me control everything.I now use the Echo all the time for lights, alarms, and daily news. The best part of the Echo is its ability to recognize multiple voices at different volumes. My parents also use it and have been considering getting one for their home!The best app to use with Alexa is IFTTT. You can have IFTTT add things to Google lists and calendars, trigger find your phone, create custom light settings for smart bulbs, and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency. These features are all great for me since I live by myself. I definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen. Echo skills also expand the use of Alexa by adding trivia games, recipe apps, and searching for hotels, flights, and movies. One of my favorites is Milo, which allows you to search for movies or tv and find where it is offered on multiple services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.The only downside I have found is you have to be very specific with some commands, such as which music service you want to access or triggering IFTTT. But Amazon has recently updated the Alexa settings with the ability to change Spotify to your default music player, so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed!If you have connected home devices or live by yourself I would definitely recommend the Echo! I have had no issues with it and it helps me everyday!",positive,"I bought impulse I heard great things it.

5070,4.0,"First and foremost the Echo is a good Bluetooth/connected speaker. It's no Sonos but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's really cool to ask her questions like you would a real person and get some good results. ""When is the cubs game/how are they doing"" and ""What are show times for Star Trek: Beyond"" yielded great results. To be honest though that novelty while very good and consistent wears off a little. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't invested in smart home tech because that is where the Echo shines. I currently have an Ecobee3, Phillips Hue, Sonos, August lock, and Harmony Hub. Right now the Echo works with Hue, Sonos, and Ecobee3 with the Harmony Hub being tested currently. There is no way to make the August work but there are ways to make other things work using apps like IFTT and Yonomi. I suggest anyone who wants one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing things you can do with this awesome little device. I can turn on and off my lights, turn on and off my different activities with Harmony, play music, lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web. It's really cool and we are closer to Star Trek than ever. It is worth the money if you want to talk to your house. I love it. There are some failings. It doesn't understand some complex wordy questions while others it has no problem with. The list of compatible devices are limited but with those two apps I spoke of, IFTT and Yonomi that list is greatly increased, and the ""skills' you can get aren't good at all. Limited and poor.

I can start a timer for various items, while cooking, and Alexa will remind me when the timer hits zero.

I no longer have to go back and check how much time is left on the washer and dryer. I can even have my Hue lights to blink when the timer has expired.Right now, I have Lutron, iDevices, and Hue Homekit devices in my house.

5152,5.0,"I love my Echo. My son had one since it first came out and frankly I was not that impressed and didn't think I would use it. I love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them, I decided to try it and thought if I didn't like it, I could take it back. Well, was I surprised!!! Ahead of buying it, I had already set up more of my Amazon Prime music playlist, and the library too. Then I also went to Pandora and created more playlists and stations there. That saved a lot of time. Set up was so simple, no problems at all. I find I use the News Briefing every morning, what's on my calendar for the day or a specific day, and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod, I usually don't unless we have company. Also, adding to shopping list and to my google calendar I use all the time. I would say the negatives are - if you have the volume up higher, she doesn't always hear you for the command. Another learning curve is the commands themselves. It is hard to remember exactly how she wants you to say the task. Right now I am writing down on index card the skills I can't seem to remember, such as Mindfullness from Prime which plays quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between Amazon Prime and Pandora, if you don't say the exact playlist name that you made, she can't find it easily. Overall, just love it - I looked into buying the Echo Dot to place that in my bedroom, but was so disappointed that they have sold out and discontinued it. There is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar, but I liked the fact that it WAS a plug in, not internal battery that only lasts a few years. I wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the Tap has a charger unit with it, more bulky, & not excellent reviews, but the Dot had great reviews.",positive,"I love Echo.

The only thing I was a little turned off by is that you cannot fully customize the wake name..yet..and you cannot connect it via Bluetooth to a soundbar/extra speaker. The overall performance of the sound that comes out of it is surprisingly great though. I just wanted more. I got over not being able to add more speakers pretty easily though. It's that good. I might suggest however adding a Harmony Home hub with it so you can REALLY take advantage of the voice features.

I bought it mainly to act as voice control for my Lutron lights on our first floor and I already had Pico remotes throughout, so it didn't get used that much. Then, it kind of clicked with some simple things like setting timers and playing podcast. Then, it got more natural when I connected the Alexa app and the Logitech Harmony app with IFTTT. Next thing you know, my wife and my son are both using it as we're coming and going to turn the lights off and on, turning on the TV, turning off when it's time for dinner etc etc. Really excited for the upcoming Sonos integration... All in all, this was a very worthwhile purchase as it's become a really strong platform for home automation and it only looks like it's going to get better.I think it's safe to say that the Echo means different things to different people... if you're into HA, then don't hesitate!",positive,"So, first, I sold this.

5315,5.0,"So we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now. Buying one piece at a time and implementing them makes the cost less scary! We have a Wink hub, Cree LED lights, MyQ garage door opener, AT&Ts Digital Life security and automation, Nest thermostat, etc. It has been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit us in real life rather than in cheesy video clips on YouTube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone. You may be wondering how the Echo fits into this review...well before Alexa came into our lives we had to have a phone or tablet on us, unlock it, find the relevant app, open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do. Now, we just say, ""Alexa, bedroom light 10%"" or ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lamp off"" or ""Alexa, play Bloodhound Gang on Spotify"", etc. The Echo makes utilizing your home automation much easier, plus with the ever growing list of 'skills' I can start my car, play a game, listen to music, get my news, control media playback, order a pizza, buy stuff from Amazon, even schedule an Uber pickup, etc. If your specific car or app or whatever isn't available yet, just give it some time and it'll most likely end up supported!

5320,3.0,"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like.

However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy.

The sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station I can play tons of stuff from Prime Music online and add skills whenever I need them from the skills store. (All the skills I've seen so far are free so ""store"" is kind of a loose term.) It responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than Siri or Cortana.

Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category.",negative,"I Amazon fanboy.

5744,4.0,"Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers and voice recognition. I can be 30 plus feet away and communicate with the Echo.2. Speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated. I compare it with the UEBoom device.3. The Amazon Echo App is very easy to manage and add in different functions to access. So many different programed commands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin.4. The design of the unit is very nice. Solid from top to bottom. Quick summary of pros:If you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather, playlists, talk radio, and reading of non-audio books back to you. You will love this unit. I was not a believer prior to purchasing the device. Alexa is much more then just a novelty. Cons:1. The amazon Echo is stationary. If you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place. So if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension cord or an outdoor plug.2. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime then half of the units greatest options are nonexistent. With Amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the Amazon music store. Also, if you have books you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those books on the Echo and have them played back to you. You can use Spotify as a secondary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlists.3. The voice commands are clumsy. What I mean by this is; you have to ask the question exactly like it says in the echo app. Some examples are, ""Alexa, What is the weather like in Manchester England?"", ""Alexa, ask PGA tour for the round leader."", or ""Alexa play the best of the 90's play list from Amazon Music?"". If you miss the ask blank. She will come back with I don't understand the question. Cons summary:These may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the commands exactly will limit the Echo's capacity. The unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic questions. Overall;If you have or plan to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moments. My family does and the Echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime, to finding out the weather, to seeing if our commute to work has any traffic to worry about. If 179.99 is not a lot of money to you for a more hands free toy. Then this is the unit for you.I hope this helps.",positive,"Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers voice recognition.

However, there are a few occasions when it is great: 1) When listening to music, getting the volume just right using voice commands can get annoying.

The Echo is good, but sometimes has difficulty hearing correctly when I have my kitchen fan on or there is a lot of other background noise. Speaking into the remote never fails (and also doesn't require you to say the wake word). 3) When in another room. I often listen to music on my Echo, even when in another room. Yelling across the house is disturbing, and doesn't always work, but the remote allows me to skip, pause, or turn off the music from my office or bedroom.

I requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of December 2014. I got an email from Amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in January. I am a prime member so I purchased it for 99 right after I got that email. It said it would be shipped out around the first week of April. However in March I received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did. So I waited 3 months from the time I requested it. I'm so glad I bought it back then because the price for prime members is now 149. Anyways I personally love the Echo. My 3 daughters love it more then I do. I have a 9, 6, and a 2.5 yr old and they all kno how to use it. My little one tries to say Alexa play Mimi (Minnie mouse) so she can hear the Mickey mouse clubhouse theme song. I primarily got this for my daughters. One of them is dyslexic and the other 2 are on the spectrum. So they need help with doing homework. Alexa comes in so handy for this especially with spelling. My dyslexic daughter mixes up letters so this feature helps her tremendously. Also being able to voice command Alexa to play a song at any time, really comes in handy when I'm trying to redirect my daughters, when they are having a melt down. My youngest is obsessed with Mickey so if I say Alexa play hot dog, my 2 yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music. So for these features make me happy! Also the music plays very clear and loud in my opinion. I didn't have any problems with the app until today. It did seem off today. However they are always updating things so I don't know if that's what caused it to be different.Read more",positive,"This review echo since can't leave review yet.

Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the Helpful button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!",positive,"I watching reviews online checking friends purchased Echo see much liked disliked features.

Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last.

5896,4.0,"These days, Amazon doesn't supply a charger when you purchase a new Kindle. That makes sense because most Kindle purchasers probably have older Kindle models already, or other USB powered devices or phones or tablets, many of which will have included chargers. As a result most people will already have a sufficient supply of chargers sitting around.But for someone who wants or needs a new charger when they order a new Kindle, Amazon presents you with the option to buy one at the time of your Kindle purchase.So I was surprised when I noticed this new charger model now being offered as an option for new Kindles. My first thought was that Amazon had updated their previous charger models to bring them up-to-date and make them competitive with the great variety of third party chargers now available (see links below for these earlier models).As soon as I looked at the specs for this charger though, I was disappointed. Unfortunately, even though this is Amazon's latest basic charger offering, it is not in my opinion the best choice for someone who needs a USB charger, for a Kindle or for anything else for that matter. And that's something I wouldn't usually find myself saying, because usually Amazon's accessories are reasonably priced and competitive.This is certainly a capable and functional charger, and it will work perfectly fine with any Kindle device and charge it acceptably well. But here are the reasons why I feel this is not the best choice:- It will supply only 1 A output, maximum. That's sufficient for a Kindle e-reader but not sufficient for many other devices. Any of the Fire devices, for example, will benefit from a higher output charger in order to reduce charging time.Read more",positive,"These days, Amazon supply charger purchase new Kindle.

6160,5.0,"I had a tough time finding reviews for this version of the Tamron. Read several reviews comparing the Nikon and the Sigma equivalents to this lens' previous version. The main draw back for the original Tamron 600mm was some design issues like lack of weather proofing. All those seem to be addressed from what I can see and have read. I have not done a high end performance test with color charts dissecting every bit of pixel like some articles I read. I can say that it works very well and the detail I get with my D810 is incredible. I took the below shot at the zoo. The weight can be off putting to some people but that comes with the territory of any large lens and I don't see this one being anything out of the ordinary when it comes to weight.

6168,5.0,"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",positive,"As bluetooth speaker, Tap rocks!

6175,5.0,"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more",positive,"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As read original review, please aware Amazon announced early February (2017) new firmware update allows Amazon Tap owners enable hands-free option!

It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions.

It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",positive,"I bought I bought Amazon Echo.

6261,5.0,"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",positive,"The Amazon Tap puts impressive amount sound small device.

6420,5.0,"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap.

I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better.

6537,5.0,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",positive,"Full disclosure.

Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more",positive,"It weeks ago I bemoaning fact I scoop Echo back released last year.

The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now.

7279,4.0,The new Fire TV has every streaming option that you can think of except VUDU. This is the only negative that we have found because we have over 100 digital copies of movies that have been either purchased or came with the blue-ray when we bought them. It is very convenient to not have to use the disc when we want to watch a movie. The Fire TV loses that convenience in that Amazon wants you to use their Prime service for digital movies. If you are going to subscribe to Amazon Prime then look no further than the Fire TV. If you have a large digital movie collection then I'd look to the Roku 4.,positive,The new Fire TV every streaming option think except VUDU.

I have the voice remotes on all of them and it makes navigating outstanding. I'm using the Fire Stick on my bedroom TV and the Fire TV on my flat screen in the family room. The main difference is that the Fire TV has a greater memory capacity than the Stick. It comes with a lot of free films, programs, games (unlike the other streaming services), music for Prime members. The options available to kids (from toddlers to grade schoolers), are incredible and include both games and videos. It allows you to keep a personal ""Watchlist"" for those things that are you faves or that you want to come back to at a later date. There's so much available with this that I can't say enough about it. It also has all the subscription services that you can test with the free trials that they offer: Sling, Hulu, HBO, Starz, and much, much more. That way, if you're really looking to cut the cable, you get a great feel as to what's out there and how much it will cost should you pick a paid service. Even if you just stick with what Amazon offers freely (and they add things all the time) you still would only be paying for the Fire TV and nothing more. Definitely a win/win for those who are fed up with being gouged over and over by digital services. With this, all you'll need is wifi, and a TV with HDMI ports....and you'll be good to go.",positive,"I happier Amazon Fire TV! I purchased Fire stick first try out.

No AirPlay of course, so I can't get rid of my ATV, and it doesn't integrate with my Macs the way ATV does.

Also, something I discovered on my own that the ""experts"" in the stores did not know or tell me: even though you don't have a 4K capable TV, the Fire Box may still be what you want instead of the Fire Stick...here's why: when you watch live news or sports they are broadcast at 30 frames per second. The Fire Stick only can produce 20 frames per second, so the picture looks somehow ""previously recorded""...jusy not like a sharp, high-def pucture.

8957,4.0,"This nifty little device is perfect for freeing yourself from the clutches of the evil and nefarious clutches of the dreaded cable empire. No longer will you be subjected to their random price raises of their already high prices. No more will you fret over paying exorbitant fees for channels that you don't even watch!! Yes this firestick can and will open up, quite literally an entire new world of viewing for you. Set up is simple and quick. There are a multitude of different apps that u can use to take complete control over what u want to watch and pay for. I'm not going to go into specifics about how to watch everything you want because we all have different interests. A simple google search will help guide you with those specifics. But just know that for financial freedom from contracts and corporate giants this is the way to go. One downside I will mention is the buffering. Ensure you have a good internet connection. This is a requirement for the device to work. Make sure u keep the device free of any unecessary apps which will take up its HD. Also ensure you have a router that is worth while. Personally I ended up going with the firebox instead of the stick because I wanted the best connection possible and as we all know that requires hard wiring of your device. So if u want to replace cable for your main living room tv area go with the box. For kids or something get them the stick.",positive,"This nifty little device perfect freeing clutches evil nefarious clutches dreaded cable empire.

It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership.",positive,"This Fire TV better choice Fire Stick connectivity standpoint LAN connection potential wireless connections.

8997,5.0,"Cord cutter here. We had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone. Since we are Prime members, we finally decided to give Amazon Fire TV a shot. We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner. Since we use Prime and Amazon Music, its a no-brainer for us to use the Fire TV. Everything syncs automatically and transfers from device to device seamlessly.Edited to add the following section after reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews:If you are a first-time cord-cutter, considering cord-cutting or new to streaming TV services, here are a few things to keep in mind.1) Make sure you really take the time to do research and due-diligence on cord-cutting. Just google ""cord cutting"" to get started with several good articles. I'm seeing a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for things like Netflix, Hulu, etc. Fire TV (and all of the other streaming services like Roku, Apple TV, etc.) do not just give you free access to all content. They allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for as opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channels you will never watch. If you do it right, you'll have access to the content you want for a substantial savings over what you were paying with cable.2) Make sure you have a strong (and fast) internet connection. This is very important. We dumped our cable company in its entirety (including internet service) and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another company. We have up to six devices simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that as well as the streaming Fire TV. So make sure yours can as well. If you're not sure, call your internet service provider, tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speeds.3) Some apps require a cable subscription. You can purchase a streaming service like Sling which will bundle several of the channels you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps. For now password sharing with one of your friends may solve that problem but I suspect its only a matter of time before that loophole gets closed. So do your research and make sure you can access the channels you want.4) Give yourself time to adjust to the new interface. It took some getting used to when I lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide. But the fact is, I'm no longer wasting large chunks of time mindlessly surfing the guide. Rather than surf, I'm turning to specific apps to watch specific programs. Its liberating in a way that I didn't expect. Besides, I can now surf all of the Amazon Prime content by simply using the voice command on the remote.",positive,"Cord cutter here. We wanting dump cable time scared leave comfort zone.

9422,5.0,FireTV is intuitive and fast. We had both a FireTV and a Fire Stick. We returned the Fire Stick because it seemed to lag a lot. Both FireTV units work well. It allows us to use PlayStation Vue as our primary live TV. A combination of PS Vue and free over the air TV (OTA with indoor antenna) allowed us to cut the cable. We did upgrade our internet as Centurylink offered a free upgrade to 40 mbps. This eliminated buffering on programs when multiple units were in use. We are very happy with the quality of picture and the channels. We will save a lot of money over time and the TV experience is great. We also like the free On Demand programming.

9445,5.0,"We purchased 2 of these for a couple of reasons. One because we were already Amazon Prime members and the other was paying too much for cable TV. Weve had them now for approx a month (one in the living room and one in the bedroom) and they work flawlessly. Easy set up (again if you're a Prime Member, just follow the on screen directions. We also subscribed to Sling TV for those channels we still wanted and purchased an outdoor antenna for locals. Fire TV has all the apps ready so they make it easy to set up what you want to watch. It can take a little getting used to apps instead of the TV guide on cable but if you have a smart phone its very similar. The Fire TV will not work with a standard IR remote so you have to use their remote provided but if you want to use only one remote for everything then I highly recommend the Logitech hub system that will control everything including the Fire TV. I have a TV, Blue Ray, Fire TV all connected through HDMI in my receiver and only have to use the one Logitech remote. Make sure you get the hub system since it works with IR, RF and blue tooth. Once everything is set up the Logitech hub app lets you control your system through your smart phone so there's no need to purchase more remotes. By the way, im not an employee of Best Buy, Logitech or Amazon just an electronics freak, but like things simple. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and won't go back to cable TV. One last thing, you still need a broadband connection, faster the better and a good wifi router to set this all up.",positive,"We purchased 2 couple reasons.

I am here to say it does and better. I wanted to try out my ethernet connection (RJ45) cable and see if it would lag or buffer. So far it has not. You can install kodi tv on this just like the fire stick. I just installed kodi version 17.1 and i must say it works faster and the movies are more clearer as well. I run it through my home audio receiver with an hdmi passthough which is more efficient for most of the smart tvs on the market today. The audio is way better i had to go to the settings on kodi and change from a 2.0 channel to 5.1 channel. It also has a sd card slot & usb drive as well don't know if i will ever need that.If you are an amazon prime member is also a good advantage as well because you can also stream any amazon prime video for free.

From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets.

But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",positive,"As video streaming device, Fire TV great, especially Prime member.

After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things.

I installed Kodi and it works great!!, Alexa is very handy and can even do shopping lists for you.

It has a MicroSD card slot which is very handy if you are planning to download a lot of games, the remote works great and comes with batteries.

11029,5.0,"This is an excellent streaming device. It has all kinds of apps and other apps that you can download and you can even hack it to put Kodi on it.

With wifi, you will have some more buffering/load times because the signal can fluctuate and go in and out sometimes. With the ethernet connection, the signal stays pretty consistent.

11030,3.0,"Fire worked fine and was simple to set up. I must add, however, that the overview menu should have more than a few on-line locations (Apps) like Netflix and YouTube. It should work as a main menu whose apps include things like liveTV, DiscPlayer, and even phonograph. Instead, it is pretty much all-Amazon. At least, if it was easy to access, it was Amazon. Aliza was not all that helpful either for non-Amazon material, certainly not for TV shows that are not in the Amazon library. I think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but Amazon. I was spoiled by my previous (Old Sony) BluRay Disc Player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything -- including Amazon.

11130,5.0,"I just bought a 4K tv so I wanted to make certain that I obtained a media player that delivered 4K content. I looked that the Roku, Apple TV, but I settled on the Amazon Fire TV because of my previous Amazon account and the price point. The device is quite elegant with a small form factor. The remote is equally small and minimal in form but quite effective. The mic works great to interact with Alexa. Just for fun, I found it interesting that Alexa will answer a question comparing it to Siri, but Siri does not reciprocate.I like that Amazon has deals to allow HBO GO streaming on it, whereas my Sony TV was not allowed to thanks to some deal between Comcast Xfinity and the networks. Other apps such as Youtube and Sling also work just fine on the app. It also syncs up to your Amazon account and on some songs, lyrics will appear on the screen like some sort of karaoke service. I thought that was a nice feature.I wish there were a few more options on it to customize loadout or app management. Also, at times the device would disconnect from my N network and connect to the G band for some reason, forcing me to manually reset it. I wish it would automatically connect to the higher band, but it's a minor complaint. The bottom of the remote can scratch easily as well, so don't slide it across the coffee table as I am apt to do.Overall, this is a great product and I have no regrets purchasing it.",positive,"I bought 4K tv I wanted make certain I obtained media player delivered 4K content.

11611,2.0,"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV.

Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice...",negative,"It's somewhat step Roku 3 I previously using, much I expecting.

Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it???s not cable. I miss cable, but I don???t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment.

11852,5.0,"This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more",positive,"This review guide cablecutters, found fire TV great way accomplish this.

We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner.Read more",positive,"Cord cutter here.

It didn't explain clearly enough that the only device it could do that with was a Kindle (although this has since changed and can now be done). That is why I didn't order the Echo when it came out.

If you let your Kindle DX swing freely back and forth the way the pages in a printed book do when you hold it by both the front and back covers, the plastic part of the case will break.

I was nervous when putting the DX down and picking it up fearing that I would drop or scratch it and there's no great way to carry the Kindle around without a cover. Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it.",positive,"My new Kindle DX2 graphite came yesterday immediately I realized I needed cover.

The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover.

The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack. To avoid this, you have to make sure the kindle doesn't rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further. This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better. One thing I can honestly say is that I really wanted to like this product. I really wanted it to work. I'm looking for a slip cover now.",negative,"The reason people give 5 stars give product enough time review it. I purchased along kindle dx August 12, 2010.

11861,5.0,This cover is a must have for your Kindle reading device. I purchased a different case initally and had to come back to get this case. It is so handy to close when reading so your screen is always protected. The Kindle is secure/locked into the case so you don't have to worry about it falling. If you buy a Kindle you MUST this case!,positive,This cover must Kindle reading device. I purchased different case initally come back get case. It handy close reading screen always protected.

11862,5.0,"I have this cover in black and my cover does indeed fold back on itself. Not sure why the other review stated that the cover does not... I wrapped the elastic band around the back part of the cover and this works great to keep it secure and out of the way. The magnets on the back help to stop from opening the cover the wrong way, but I used a small piece of two faced tape on the back of the Kindle and no more trouble opening it the wrong way now, works great! I am very happy with this cover.",positive,"I cover black cover indeed fold back itself. Not sure review stated cover not... I wrapped elastic band around back part cover works great keep secure way.

11863,5.0,"I found this cover to be quite handsome in appearance (EVERYONE who sees it comments on how cool or how nice it is!), very simple, and very functional. It's VERY easy to attach the Kindle DX to it and the fit is perfect. Most importantly, it appears Amazon has solved the older problem with this cover somehow damaging the Kindle if one opened the cover from the back too far. Now, there is a small magnet embedded in the back of the cover that gently keeps the back cover snug to the Kindle DX and serves to gently remind you, with a gentle tug, if you accidentally attempt to open your Kindle backwards. For me, it's an elegant and well-thought-out solution.",positive,"I found cover quite handsome appearance (EVERYONE sees comments cool nice is!), simple, functional.

11864,1.0,"I, as well as other Kindle lovers, have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover, it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable. Within 3 months, and I only started using the Kindle with the cover in the past 2 weeks, noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather. No idea what would cause this, I have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage, not sunlight, heat, moisture or anything. I will be requesting a replacement, but Kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product, especially for the price we paid.",negative,"I, well Kindle lovers, noticed although taken great care cover, warped bubbles durable.

11865,3.0,"This cover is a replacement for the initial cover that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge goes into the Kindle. The metal on the original hinge system was too light weight to withstand having the cover fold all the way back on the Kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge becoming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my Kindle.I understand this new Kindle cover is supposed to have corrected that problembut the hinge system looks identical to the one that was on my old cover. I hope that over time, again, about a year plus it won't crack the frame in the same place again on my new Kindle.I am so thankful that Amazon replace both my Kindle and the book cover as a result of this problem.I would recomend that after about 6 months use it would be wise to remove the cover from your Kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact Amazon before the frame of your Kindle breaks where the top hinge inserts into your Kindle.",negative,"This cover replacement initial cover broke kindle framewhere top hinge goes Kindle.

That's when I found this little jewel along with the Kindle Fire AC charger. And they both work like a DREAM!. My desk stays uncluttered and the cord allows me to keep the Kindle plugged in while I read in bed or listen to music.

11868,4.0,"Amazon already includes this cable with the Kindle Fire 7, the Kindle Fire HD 7 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's also great to purchase as a back up for the office or to take with you on the go. For the peace of mind knowing Amazon designed this to work specifically with Kindle Fire, it's worth the price.The quality of this cable compared to the previous white USB cable is much better. This cable has a thicker jacket on the outside so hopefully overtime it will hold up much better. Data transfer speeds between the computer and the device are relatively quick. This cable is actually a bit shorter than the white cable even though both are supposed to be 5 ft. in length. Measuring both cables, the black cable is approx 5 ft. and the white cable is approx 5 ft. 9in. Overall, even though it is shorter, this cable is starting off to be a much better improvement than the previous white version of this cable.",positive,"Amazon already includes cable Kindle Fire 7, Kindle Fire HD 7 Kindle Fire HD 8.9.

For 20 you don't even get a full charger, just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you. Amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories, this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty.",negative,"So I already pleased Amazon's choice include essentially useless charger purchasing kindle hd, caved ordering fast charger would take hours non-use recharge.
