0,3.0,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,negative
1,5.0,This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!,positive
2,4.0,"Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark",positive
3,5.0,"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.",positive
4,5.0,Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.,positive
5,5.0,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.,positive
6,5.0,"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com.",positive
7,4.0,I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge,positive
8,5.0,"amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model",positive
9,5.0,"It's beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though.",positive
10,5.0,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional.

19,4.0,Everything is great except that i can't read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome!,positive
20,1.0,"I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it.",negative
21,4.0,This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.,positive

28,5.0,I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.,positive
29,4.0,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.",positive
30,4.0,My fianc?©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,positive
31,4.0,"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader.",positive

39,5.0,I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful!,positive

50,5.0,"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars.",positive
51,3.0,The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,negative
52,4.0,"After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeks-best Buy replaced it with no fuss and it's going great. Small, lightweight (so fits in a purse/handbag) and with the anti-glare screen you can read in direct sunlight",positive
53,5.0,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.",positive
54,5.0,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",positive
55,5.0,I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark.,positive
56,5.0,the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library,positive
57,5.0,"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.",positive
58,5.0,"This is a great way to read books on the go. There's no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it's affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you.",positive
59,5.0,"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.",positive
60,4.0,i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone.,positive
61,5.0,"We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. ""Why would U want to read in the dark?"" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect.",positive
62,4.0,"Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too",positive
63,5.0,Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient,positive
64,5.0,I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month,positive
65,5.0,it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done.,positive
66,5.0,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.",positive
67,5.0,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",positive
68,5.0,Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.,positive
69,4.0,Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from.,positive
70,1.0,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,negative
71,4.0,My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,positive
72,3.0,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.",negative
73,5.0,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places.",positive
74,5.0,Great product and service and the sales man r really nice.,positive
75,4.0,"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.",positive
76,5.0,"My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003.",positive
77,4.0,"It's small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you're on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it.",positive
78,3.0,This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.,negative
79,4.0,"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.",positive
80,2.0,it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark,negative
81,5.0,"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous.",positive
82,3.0,"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good.",negative
83,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.,positive
84,4.0,"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work",positive
85,4.0,"I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger.",positive
86,5.0,Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where,positive
87,4.0,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two.",positive
88,5.0,My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.,positive
89,5.0,Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.,positive
90,4.0,"I love my Kindle! I'm back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times! At first it surprised me that this version doesn't have a back light and you need a light to read, but I actually like it now as I don't get the eye strain like I do when using my phone.",positive
91,3.0,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.",negative
92,5.0,It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.,positive
93,2.0,"The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness",negative

98,5.0,"We bought this for mother in law, buying another for me.",positive
99,5.0,"Well designed, good sound, has everything Alexa has plus the HD video. Always ready with answers with associated video or text if applicable. Can show movie trailers, can also watch Amazon video. Excellent on-demand security video with Amazon compatible cameras. Voice activated message and/or video calls to Amazon Show owners or Alexa App holders. Highly recommended.",positive

106,5.0,I purchased this for my daughter and when I tell you she was so happy she hugged the box then me and back to the box!,positive
107,4.0,Overall product is excellent. Speakers should have a capability to be used as Bluetooth speakers like the echo.,positive
108,5.0,"I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol",positive
109,5.0,"I was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but I am so glad I did! Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95% right with any command that I have given. Love the fact that I can see things on the screen. Some of my news briefings have a picture/video so that's nice too. We also love the video call option. Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced, and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids. Worth every penny.",positive
110,5.0,"Great product, very much recommended. Service at Best buy is always the best",positive
111,5.0,"I bought 2 of these for gifts. I love my Echo and think the new one will be incredible too! After the holidays, I will buy one for myself!",positive
112,5.0,"I can watch videos, check my security cameras, and grey two for a fantastic price",positive
113,4.0,"Dreams need topics, song lyrics scroll during song play, watch movies/trailers and etc. With it, if you can get it on sale, bought my for special deal at Best Buy for $129.99. not sure if the value is there at the regular price of$249.99. but it is very cool device.",positive

117,5.0,"I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen. I use the Show to display recipes when cooking, lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family. I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature.",positive

119,5.0,"this echo show lets you see so much, great item for your home!",positive
120,5.0,The Echo is very easy to use and has features that allow users to converse easily with others who may have a hard time learning how to communicate using newer videophone technology. This product removes those barriers.,positive
121,4.0,I love my echo show I wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon.,positive
122,5.0,Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well. Was able to look in my house while away. Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future.,positive
123,4.0,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house.",positive
124,5.0,"It's at its heart an echo, but having a screen on it, with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus",positive
125,5.0,Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen.,positive
126,5.0,I have 2 of these in my house work great I just bought 4 for Christmas gifts for my family,positive
127,5.0,"We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday!",positive
128,5.0,The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.,positive
129,5.0,It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this!,positive
130,4.0,"I‚Äôm a big echo fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot, but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise.",positive
131,5.0,"I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing. Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging, my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors. So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things. We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control. It's a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time.",positive
132,4.0,"We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!",positive
133,5.0,We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews,positive
134,5.0,Love playing music and talking to Alexa and looking at my camera three the screen,positive
135,5.0,"I love the Echo Show and this is the 3rd one I have purchased (two were presents for family at Christmas). This one was for me. I love being able to hear music, connect with family via video and ask Alexa questions. Best purchase I could have made!",positive

137,4.0,I love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands.,positive
138,5.0,Screen is really nice great for videos I would definetly recommend it,positive
139,4.0,"We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights...",positive
140,5.0,By far my favorite Amazon product. I bought one for every bedroom in the home.,positive
141,5.0,"Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes, so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too, it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though, but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly, to have lyrics on the screen when music is played!",positive
142,5.0,I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product,positive
143,2.0,"I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....",negative
144,5.0,My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit.,positive
145,4.0,Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!,positive
146,5.0,Replaced a regular echo with this unit. Allows video chat with our son in college and replaces a digital picture frame at a very affordable price.,positive
147,5.0,We love the echo show. Best feature is the flash bringing that gives us a rundown on news and weather each morning.,positive
148,5.0,"My girlfriend loves the echo show, I bought two of them...",positive
149,5.0,"Along with fire TV, a prime membership, an amazon music subscription, other home automation devices and the Alexa app on the phone this system is very functional.",positive
150,5.0,"It‚Äôs Alexa, but it has a screen, and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device. My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes, weather music and fun!",positive
151,4.0,I purchased this as present for a friend and since I have an Echo I can video chat with her to check in. The quality of the video is great.,positive

155,5.0,"The Echo Show is a game changer, it's amazing as are all the Echo's but with this one you can watch video's, or see who's at your door. The things that Echo can do are limitless, it's like having a personal assistant.",positive
156,5.0,"Another great product by Amazon, super fun and great for entertaining the family and guests.",positive
157,5.0,Great product fun to use. Very easy to set up and begin useing,positive
158,4.0,Gift for a relative they said they loved the gift.,positive
159,5.0,Same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product.,positive
160,4.0,Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family. We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub.,positive
161,5.0,I live the echo show! So easy to set up and use. I have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom.,positive
162,3.0,"Alexa may be new, but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already. For the amount Amazon charges, it should come with better instructions, including what specifically to download into one's device (iPhone, etc.) so as to make some apps ready to go. Amazon dropped the ball on this one.",negative
163,5.0,"I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe, it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device!",positive
164,5.0,"I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try, my kids use it to help with homework, my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it.",positive

170,5.0,"I find myself saying to my phone, ""Alexa, play........."". I wish they made it for my car too.",positive
171,5.0,"Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras. I use it to view our cameras, listen to music, make phone calls/video calls and even as a recipe guide when cooking. I‚Äôve been very impressed!",positive
172,4.0,Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible,positive
173,4.0,"I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table.",positive
174,5.0,Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.,positive
175,5.0,I recently purchased the Amazon show. It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen. Extremely glad I bought it.,positive

183,4.0,I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa,positive
184,4.0,"I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better",positive
185,5.0,Everyone should have this product. It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone.,positive
186,5.0,"When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7"" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the ""Front Porch"", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!",positive
187,5.0,This is actually for a gift. Second one I purchased But great priduct,positive

191,5.0,Connects with Echo Dot and Bluetooth with ease. Works great,positive
192,5.0,"We love our echo. Use it everyday. One thing, it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, but that's not always the case. It's not a big deal, just get a little closer or louder and she follows the request/answers the question. Love it!",positive
193,5.0,Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa,positive
194,4.0,"At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies, YouTube videos etc.",positive
195,4.0,"I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen. I use it for EVERYTHING, music, video, phone, security cams, news, weather. It's the perfect kitchen assistant.",positive

198,5.0,If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you,positive
199,5.0,"For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside ""smart"" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!",positive
200,5.0,"She is Alexa, better younger sister. Love her, and some of the new skills great",positive
201,5.0,The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up,positive
202,5.0,This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.,positive
203,5.0,"This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired.",positive
204,5.0,"It‚Äôs good, but not google smart, it answers when no one asks. Kind of spooky. The distinction in the voice context is absent",positive
205,5.0,I like the ease and usage of the amazon show. I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call. Overall great product!,positive

207,4.0,"The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency. Easy to set up and works well. There should be a manual to accompany the product. Going online encourages the purchase of a book of directions, rather than a simple online manual.",positive
208,5.0,I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa. Great speakers.,positive
209,4.0,"I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one.",positive
210,5.0,I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.,positive
211,5.0,no problems so far I'm enjoying it. suggestion : it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers / sound system,positive
212,4.0,"We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well.",positive
213,5.0,This is not my first Echo product - we have 3 Echo dots. This is a step up for us. I have it placed in the kitchen and love it! The sound is outstanding and I love the screen feature. I will be buying additional ones for family as well as myself.,positive

215,4.0,"almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy, Once in a while it doesn't hear you right but that's probably due to being 10 - 15 feet away with the tv on other than that no problems",positive
216,5.0,This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it.,positive
217,5.0,I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo. This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it!!,positive
218,4.0,"We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device. My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it. Not huge deals at all, but minutely disappointing.",positive
219,5.0,"This is awesome and the sound is amazing, the screen is outstanding",positive
220,5.0,"Very neat item, fun to talk to. Easy set up to use.",positive

226,4.0,"Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know?",positive
227,5.0,Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information,positive
228,5.0,I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!!,positive
229,2.0,It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having.,negative
230,5.0,Adds some nice tricks to the regular Echo lineup. Video calls to other Show owners works well. Speakers sound good.,positive
231,3.0,"THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL, BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE. MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED.",negative
232,5.0,"It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!",positive
233,4.0,I seen one that my son-in-law had and enjoyed using it.,positive
234,5.0,"I love how I can see my grandkids. I also bought my kids one so they can just ""Drop In"" and I can see them. It also shows words to some songs to sing along. It is fun to have!!",positive

240,5.0,"The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub.",positive
241,4.0,"The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.",positive
242,5.0,"This is the best assistant from Amazon, with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices!Simply awesome!",positive

246,5.0,i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices. Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great!,positive
247,4.0,"If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.",positive
248,5.0,"Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!",positive
249,5.0,"9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can't compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights, simple cooking measurements, simple math, travel time, store location hours, calling, and video calling.... and more. Everything else like, news, calendars, weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above.",positive
250,5.0,Love the many features ! Highly recommend it! using the echo saves me lots of unnecessary work... and that‚Äôs amazing!,positive
251,5.0,"Used in my home office, gives me all of the information I ask for while my computers are doing other chores. Plays any music that I request, decent quality sound.",positive
252,3.0,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out.",negative
253,5.0,I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine,positive
254,5.0,Great sound and amazing options. Love this!!! Great replacement for original echo,positive

262,5.0,"The Echo Show is a very awesome product because of Alexa itself! She will answer questions you ask her, play music on your demand, and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you. I also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything I've ever seen in a hybrid tablet product. A must have for your home!",positive
263,5.0,it works well and sounds very good and the pictures are good too,positive
264,5.0,Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed. The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great. The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes. The display is also very vivid and clear.,positive
265,1.0,Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn't work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you'll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead.,negative

Search a recipe and use it without flipping through recipe books. Need to know a measurement conversion? Just ask Alexa! Learn cooking techniques, recommended cooking times...endless list of available answers. Great addition to my kitchen. LOVE that we can play Christmas music throughout our home using all our Echo devices. Lots of fun. This works just like all echo products,,,.with smart accessories you can control your home thermostat, lights etc. Alot of expandable options.",positive

276,5.0,"I got this as a spur of the moment thing. I figured it was going to be super gimmicky but was pleasantly surprised that it's actually a very helpful device for organizing, shopping, smart home control, listening to music, or even watching some videos while I'm washing dishes. My show is in my kitchen and I've used it for countless things. I think this is amazon's best Alexa yet.",positive
277,5.0,Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it! He is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday. Nice to tell Alexa to keep track of what we need at the store. Can‚Äôt wait to use it more!,positive

294,5.0,"I bought the Alexa Show on a whim, and it was a great decision. My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself.",positive
295,5.0,My daughter bought a show so my 10 year old grandson could get in touch with her when he got home from school so I bought one so he could call us and we can see each other. We love it.,positive

300,5.0,"I already have 6 Amazon devices (2 Echo's and 4 Dot's). I expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only Amazon device I have with a screen. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen, and most of them have been very helpful. I'm planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house. She'll get a kick out of it also.",positive
301,5.0,Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more.,positive
302,5.0,"Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is ""show"", so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do ""drop in"", which is essentially visual phone calls. It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.",positive
303,5.0,"Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go.",positive
304,4.0,"The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as ""play"" or ""start"" or ""open"") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don't really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like. I don't see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading.",positive
305,5.0,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",positive
306,5.0,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :),positive

368,3.0,"Its a great product, but for the cost, the speakers are not what they should be, and the screen is too small. Choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out. Hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem, and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls. Voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot. I am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance.",negative

370,5.0,Good for Amazon music and news. Brilliant for controlling lights in the house.,positive
371,5.0,"I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.",positive
372,4.0,"This is an awesome device, but it isn't life changing. It is basically the same as the Echo. I don't use the video much.",positive

381,5.0,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.,positive
382,4.0,We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesn‚Äôt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me.,positive
383,3.0,"I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues.",negative
384,5.0,Got one for my mom in order to video chat with her. Works awesome.,positive
385,5.0,"Such an easy set up. My family and I use it for so many things. Wake up in the morning, the morning commute traffic report. Recipes, facts, phone calls and of course music! Since I got it and have had friends and family over, they have gone out to buy it as well. Excellent purchase. Well worth the money!",positive
386,5.0,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home.",positive
387,5.0,"Amazing. I seriously didn't know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show. While I have Alex Echo (and love this), having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing. I love the jokes, random questions I can ask or telling me the weather. Its essential in our house now.",positive
388,5.0,"The best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos, the security cameras connected to your house, listen to music and watch the baby sleep. I love my Echo Show.",positive
389,5.0,"Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price, I couldn't order it fast enough! I can see my Nest cameras (another 5 * product), make video calls to other Show owners, voice calls to anyone else (except 911) and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily. My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale. I won't make that mistake on next big sale.I also received 2 of the 'other' home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things. I thought that it was only fair to compare the two, disregarging the video aspects of Show. Amazon's Shows and Dots. Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a '68 VW Bug. Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid, ""Easier than fallin' of a log and not near as dangerous.""",positive

393,4.0,I love the Alexa system of assistance. This version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won‚Äôt get to have to the option to pick up.

457,5.0,Great and easy to set up. We have this in the hallway and the whole family uses it. Alexa is learning what our family likes each day. My 8 yr old daughter uses it all the time as well.,positive
458,5.0,I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven't used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two.,positive
459,4.0,This product worked very well and very easy to use.,positive
460,5.0,"This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy",positive
461,3.0,"The three star review is for the situation described here, not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up, however, it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn't a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it. After you hook it up, make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go.",negative
462,5.0,"Love that I can view my arlo cams on it , love it plays movie trailers on point , love the lyrics when playing music , love the video calls, love the drop in to other Alexa devices around the house (they now work as intercoms) so I can be in the 3rd floor of my house (3 story home in Las Vegas ) the doorbell rings I can say alexa show me front door (arlo cam) then I can say alexa open front door, drop in on the echo by front door and say come on up , Just having a blast with this stuff , yes I am in deep with the smart home thing.. alexa turn on the lights (hue color lights) , turn on the fan (wemo switches) Alexa set house to 77 degrees (nest ) so endless , yeah I would say the ECHO SHOW IS A GOOD START ...",positive
463,5.0,I use this thing every night to fall asleep. Although Alexa don‚Äôt always understand me I still love the device.,positive
464,5.0,"Finally decided to try Alexa. Lights, heating, doors, etc... everything is homekit compatible in my house. But this one was too tempting! What a great device. Alexa is years ahead of Siri, great system to have by your bed, and it also controls most of my devices...",positive
465,4.0,"Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too.",positive
466,3.0,"The device works well mechanically, however, the software needs a lot of work. Half of my commands are not understood and I have cameras linked up to it that‚Äôs rarely recognized.",negative

477,5.0,I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter !,positive
478,5.0,"This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot, except it has a screen. If you already liked the Echo's this is a good addition. The addition of the screen is neat, but certainly not essential. You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen. You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it. You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well, but you'll probably just watch that on a phone, tablet or TV instead.",positive
479,5.0,I love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff,positive
480,5.0,Just love it. Some very innovative. Very user friendly,positive
481,4.0,This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal.,positive
482,5.0,Bought this for my mom. She thinks it's great. It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items.,positive
483,5.0,The video screen really adds wonderfully to the functionality of the echo devices.,positive

486,5.0,"Got this for my mother who's eye site has been failing to the point of not being able to dial the phone or write down appointments. She can now video chat with members of the family. Send emails, check her appointments, place phone calls just by requesting it. It has helped her so much.",positive
487,3.0,Nice device. Good to enable drop in conversations. Some flash briefings. But overall still a little limited in effective use of video,negative
488,5.0,"My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù home...while I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo, I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed! Great product, I can rave enough about them!!!",positive

496,5.0,I bought 2 shows and I am loving them. Them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized. I don't have to keep my phone on me 24/7 to keep in touch with my closest family members; they can just drop in and I can do the same with the kids when away from the house. I made 2 more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room. I love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly. They are a must have for a modern home.,positive
497,5.0,Enjoying Alexa! There is so much you can ask her! Looking forward to the security monitoring .,positive
498,5.0,I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one.,positive
499,4.0,Product works well and is fairly simple to operate,positive

505,5.0,I didn't expect this device to be so diverse unexpected surprise,positive
506,5.0,THIS IS AWESOME WE LOVE IT SO MUCH TALK & C PEEPS!!!,positive

508,5.0,Love this thing. Little apprehensive at first. But Alexa will grow on you,positive
509,5.0,"We love our echo show, It‚Äôs fun to use and she can do a lot of things.",positive
510,5.0,"When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it.",positive
511,5.0,Too many great things to say about the echo show! I have had an echo dot for a while but the new echo who adds video. I literally use it everyday multiple times a day. Great product Amazon!,positive
512,3.0,"Great sound, easy set up. The screen seems sort of wasteful now that I've been playing with it. Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame....I'm just certain yet. I was able to set one picture to it...Not multiple. Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear. I like the visual to do and shopping lists. Still worth the purchase. A good want to have...just not a must have...then again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do.",negative
513,5.0,"Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices, I have two echos and one dot, it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door Bell,I can see who is at my front door without opening it.",positive
514,5.0,It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites,positive
515,1.0,"Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the 'newest, hottest' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me ""Alexa find videos on f450 drone"" Alexa ""YouTube is not available"". Amazon won't directly sell chrome products, youtube won't play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet.",negative
516,5.0,It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.,positive
517,5.0,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.,positive
518,4.0,Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa. Needs more skills. And need YouTube to work!,positive
519,5.0,If you like video this goes along perfect ...a must buy,positive
520,5.0,"Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it! Full of great information, weather and more. Can control lights and various things at the house. Even askes you the question of the day! Easy set up and to use. Mainly bought it to monitor the Arlo Pro 2 cameras we purchased.",positive
521,3.0,Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone,negative
522,5.0,Great device. Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view!!,positive
523,5.0,"I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo, echo 2.0, and obviously dot. Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock",positive
524,5.0,This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring. It was priced well and I find it useful.,positive
525,4.0,We are new to connected home equipment. I got this for my wife in our kitchen. The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app. Not a deal breaker by any means though. We love it,positive
526,5.0,I love my new Alexa Show. Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away. Product is great. Easy setup and works as stated. Staff very helpful. Would recommend this product and definitely this model. :),positive

535,4.0,Great sound and picture. Been using as a baby monitor. Still new to Alexa so still learning what she can do,positive
536,3.0,"The Echo was so good, I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons, one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,""Google is not supported on Echo Show."" Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money. I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home.",negative
537,5.0,"Having LOTS of fun with Alexa! Tells us weather, stories, plays music trivia games with us, helps with shopping list, and can face to face talk with my sister in another state (bought one for her too) - great addition to our home!",positive

546,5.0,My mother has dementia and this keeps her busy for periods of time. She is fun to have around.,positive
547,4.0,Just got this in the mail last night. Setting it up today and I want to love it. The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly. The display in the store had great sound.,positive

550,5.0,Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device.,positive
551,5.0,"The Echo Show is a version of Alexa with ability to visualize things.

558,5.0,The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music.,positive
559,4.0,"I saw there was a new Echo with a screen and had to have it. I use it for Amazon Prime videos, YouTube, music with lyrics, recipes, and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam. The speaker is louder than I thought. Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen.",positive
560,4.0,This is the main reason why I went with Amazon's Echo ecosystem vs Google Home. I bought one as a gift to my sister so I can easily videochat with my family. My niece and nephew tend to fight over the Echo Show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen. My only wish was that there was an HDMI out to connect it to a larger monitor. Huge missed opportunity in my opinion.,positive
561,3.0,I'm disappointed. Sometimes gives doesn't understand,negative
562,5.0,Echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from,positive
563,5.0,"I didn‚Äôt think I would like the Echo Show ‚Äîespecially at the $200+ price point, but I tried it and love it! If I could afford it, and if they would add an audio port, I would replace my current Alexas with Echo Shows.",positive

565,5.0,"The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. .",positive

568,5.0,"We have echos throughout the whole house and have this in the kitchen. Controls lights , you can FaceTime , my wife uses it for recipes and it shows the videos of directions",positive
569,4.0,"This item is a great addition to your smart home, but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet. The kinks still needs to be worked out. Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands. There's a long learning curve. Setting up with apps is a lot work. It's fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each. Great landline replacement.",positive
570,5.0,We are enjoying our amazon echo show. Alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music!!!!,positive
571,5.0,Great device to stay in touch with your family if you leave in another city or state!,positive

574,2.0,Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device.,negative
575,5.0,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!",positive

607,5.0,Video calls work great and the screen is super informative.,positive

609,5.0,"I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.",positive
610,4.0,"Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking.",positive

616,5.0,"I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)!

617,5.0,"The show is our new best friend. We watch shows on it everyday at lunch time. And we end every night saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off screen‚Äù",positive
618,5.0,"this is pretty cool, we love ours, we listen to music and the sound is great, my kids are always asking her questions, we can call on it, set reminers, timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you, like even though I have a prime membership, all music is not available , I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there, even though I upgraded it ,if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time, to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it.",positive
619,5.0,Love it . Easy to use. No problems setting it up!!!!,positive
620,4.0,"Very impressed; set up a little confusing, but overall a good experience. Still learning. However, Best Buy emails give away any gift secrets !! Had to reset my account to a work email address.",positive
621,4.0,"Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products. The Show is a great addition for us in the kitchen, displaying receipts and visualizing things that before could only be heard.",positive
622,5.0,So easy to set up. Still learning what she can do. Happy so far.,positive
623,5.0,I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality.,positive

625,5.0,easy setup and we can now talk to each other and see each other very easy. great way to keep in touch without a computer.,positive
626,4.0,Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition.,positive
627,5.0,I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices.,positive
628,5.0,Bought for sons & family they have small children and I never miss out on seeing them live .. love it,positive
629,5.0,It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside.,positive
630,4.0,"This is a very nice concept, and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills. The design is a little clunky.... Google's version looks nicer, but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to.",positive
631,3.0,"The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement",negative
632,5.0,"Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple product.You can watch someone show you how to do something, like a project you are working on. Instead of listening, you can see it!",positive
633,5.0,Alexa is now a family member. How have I lived my life without her I have no idea...........,positive
634,4.0,Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial,positive
635,5.0,Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather,positive
636,5.0,This is a fantastic item & the person I bought it for loves it.,positive
637,5.0,Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest.,positive
638,5.0,"It syncs with my Echo, displays slideshows, recipes, and lists, controls my Fire Stick, and sounds pretty good. It doesn't play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos.",positive
639,5.0,"The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents, who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen. Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes/videos is great. It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices, you don‚Äôt even need to use the app,",positive
640,5.0,I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time,positive
641,5.0,I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing!,positive
642,5.0,"This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it's great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it's random invitations to ""try"" certain skills, but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con's that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can't differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too, and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home.",positive
643,5.0,"This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product. I used to have the Alexa Echo, but moved that up to my bedroom. Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality. I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras. Great product.",positive
644,5.0,Works well. Haven't been able to work out the local traffic yet.,positive
645,5.0,Love my amazon echo show however I wish Alexa knew a little bit more.,positive
646,5.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter's 22nd birthday and she totally loved it. Now she's wanting me to buy a second one so that I can keep it on the first floor. She says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other. I think it was a great purchase so I think I'm going to have to buy another one.,positive
647,4.0,Works good. Have to be very careful with kids. Overall good product,positive
648,5.0,Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.,positive
649,5.0,"Got this so Grandma could stay in touch with Grandchildren, Works great and easy to use",positive
650,5.0,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",positive
651,3.0,"It's neat. It does what all other amazon alexis' do, but a little more. I feel as if should still do more.",negative
652,5.0,This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting.,positive
653,5.0,Thoroughly enjoy my new show. Love the scrolling pictures.,positive
654,5.0,I brought my tube amplifier to Best Buy and my Magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of B&W 700 Series 2 speakers. WOW...It sounded like Etta James was right in the room! Fantastic!,positive
655,4.0,Works great. Very responsive and quick. I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes.,positive
656,4.0,Love the look- love the size- love that it is VISUAL!!,positive
657,4.0,I like it. Currently it is the only smart system with display. It makes it easier to talk to the device. My only issue with it that it has a slow processor.,positive
658,4.0,"Yes, it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though.",positive
659,5.0,Great item to upgrade your house. Works very well.,positive
660,5.0,Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products,positive
661,5.0,"Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen! The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes, getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music!",positive
662,4.0,Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.,positive
663,1.0,"Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.",negative
664,5.0,This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.,positive
665,4.0,"Makes things easy to do like listen to music, check the weather, hear the news,etc. just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you.",positive
666,5.0,"Great to have for time, recipe, or entertainment I recommend everyone get it",positive
667,5.0,This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use. I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 4.99 a month that‚Äôs a deal.,positive
668,5.0,The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands. The opportunities with this are endless.,positive
669,4.0,"I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home. It works well with smart outlets, our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest Thermostat.My only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it's hard to get it to stop. Still all in all we're happy with the purchase.",positive
670,4.0,"It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.",positive
671,5.0,"Amazon hit it out of the park with this one. I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well. Songs come with lyrics, sound and looks great.",positive
672,5.0,Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights,positive
673,5.0,I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.,positive
674,4.0,loved the echo show. my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift. Other than that the product is great. Easy to use.,positive
675,5.0,"This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke.",positive
676,5.0,I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer. I enjoy this one as it is video capable. The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms.,positive
677,4.0,"I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too.",positive
678,5.0,"Is better than face time when calling my kid, since they have one, IÔ?è could call them from my and see them at the same time, perfect for cooking timer n best for music",positive
679,4.0,"Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment.",positive
680,5.0,I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video.,positive
681,5.0,As advertised......................................,positive
682,5.0,I love my echo show it does so many interesting things I‚Äôm on it all the time I recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting up to date information,positive
683,5.0,I am enjoying the Echo Show a lot.Very entertaining,positive
684,5.0,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home.",positive
685,5.0,"Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices",positive
686,4.0,I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen. At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that. The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa.,positive
687,5.0,"Easy to install, very easy to use, we enjoy the product and learn more about it all the time",positive
688,4.0,Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product,positive
689,5.0,"We have the original Echo, two Echo Dots and the Echo Show to complete the family - love the ability to play videos and the lyrics display on Prime Music is awesome!",positive
690,5.0,"Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc.",positive
691,5.0,I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating. Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa.,positive
692,5.0,"Our whole family loves, and uses this device for so many different features. We love using it to make phone calls, watch films, play Jeopardy, even to define words as they come up in conversation. We definitely get a lot of use out of this device, more than any other screen, tablet, or smart phone device we own.",positive
693,4.0,"FUN TO USE FOR ANY AGE JUST SAY ALEXA""""""""""""""""""""""""""""",positive
694,5.0,"A nice ""next step"" in the Alexa repertoire; easy to set up and to use.",positive
695,4.0,It is so convenient to have a display with Alexa function.,positive
696,5.0,I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing. When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price. Love this product am glad I purchased it. Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions.,positive
697,4.0,"So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.",positive
698,5.0,"this product features a beautiful screen to enhance your viewing and information, love this product",positive
699,5.0,Simply love it! It‚Äôs loud... love watching videos!!,positive
700,5.0,This product is amazing. I do however wish that there were more video features on it!,positive
701,5.0,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!,positive
702,5.0,The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .,positive
703,3.0,"This item seems great on the ads, but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much. To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù, some of which work well and others of which do not. Some are reviewed, but many are not. Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device (which no body tells you). I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful, but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain.",negative
704,5.0,Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.,positive
705,5.0,Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our children's families during this holiday season!,positive
706,5.0,"With this you can make calls to other echo shows. Or using the app you can call others that have the a show. I haven't used this feature yet since I'm the only one I know who has one. I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show. I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door. I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever, wherever you have it. Keep in mind you're only gonna see what it's pointed at. The camera doesn't move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room. After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life.",positive
707,5.0,Love the new Echo Show! Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away. My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking. Music sounds great coming from this small unit. It was the talk of Christmas!,positive
708,5.0,Got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc?© and they love it. Works great with Phillips Hue,positive
709,5.0,"I love this new Alexa device with the screen. I bought it for my mother who really couldn't ""relate"" to the Echo Dot. But she can read the output. I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day. Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking, and see them too!",positive
710,5.0,I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen.,positive
711,5.0,We already love our other Alexa/Echo devices and this is our favorite. The drop in video chat feature is my favorite!,positive
712,5.0,"Nice to see songs, and many other items. Shows words to music, can watch u tube. And video calls.",positive
713,5.0,Nice to have .good thing to used love to . Would tell people about,positive
714,4.0,"I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good.",positive
715,4.0,I have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,positive
716,5.0,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly.,positive
717,5.0,Bought it for my son & wife. They love it. Both thought they didn‚Äôt need it. They find that it is a lot of fun and very useful.,positive
718,5.0,Very impress with the echo show and all of its features,positive
719,5.0,I think this is one of Amazon best products ever. I first review the echo online and watch youtube video. It is better than I read or saw on line.,positive
720,5.0,"This device is seriously cool. The basic functions out of the box are nice, but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more. My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice. Smart home integration is a big draw!",positive
721,4.0,Nice device. We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation.,positive
722,4.0,The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be.,positive
723,4.0,"If Amazon and Google can work things out, the Show will be amazing! We already loved the Echo and the Dot, and were looking forward to adding video. Unfortunately, YouTube is no longer on the Show, limiting the video content. If they can ever get it back, the Show will definitely be a 5 star product!",positive
724,5.0,"The show is definitely amazing, especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras, you can see it with echo show.",positive
725,5.0,I love this product! The possibilities are endless!,positive
726,5.0,It's great! I love the hand free whatever you want. It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play. At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well. Highly recommend,positive
727,5.0,Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling.,positive
728,5.0,"Absolutely Awesome! Great product, recommend that Everyone have one!",positive
729,5.0,"Traded my original echo for echo show. Glad I did, screen is excellent and syncs with many home connected devices.",positive
730,5.0,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.,positive
731,5.0,I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets. I didn't liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good. I like it more then I except it. Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon.,positive
732,5.0,Amazon echo show working very well (as expected) and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis.,positive
733,4.0,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product.",positive
734,5.0,Delivered on time and it looked good will hook it up next year.,positive
735,5.0,This is the most amazing item. And very easy to use,positive
736,4.0,I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information,positive
737,5.0,Best Xmas gift and great product made by amazon. Now my fam is all connected.,positive
738,5.0,"bought these for family members out of state for Christmas, finding it is way more than expected. Can talk face to face with them, make shopping lists, listen to stories, play interactive trivia music games, is there no end to possibilities? They all LOVED their gift (thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable)...",positive
739,4.0,"We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around.",positive
740,3.0,"Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things. But it's restricted to only Amazon partner things. If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show. No YouTube.",negative
741,5.0,"Love the Echo Show. Allows me to control lights, alarm, vacuum and lots of stuff. No brainer to set up. Make lists, keep up with calendar. Plays music. Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.",positive
742,4.0,"We're still learning all the things this device can do. So far, We're very pleased.",positive
743,5.0,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.,positive
744,5.0,We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system. The Echo Show is a perfect addition. We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features.,positive
745,5.0,Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use,positive
746,4.0,"I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google's terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation.",positive
747,5.0,Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
748,5.0,Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.,positive
749,4.0,This is great! Like having a robot brain in your house.,positive
750,5.0,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",positive
751,5.0,This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!,positive
752,5.0,"This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news, you can set alarms and do so much more. We love this product",positive
753,5.0,I couldn't believe how easy and fast the setup was. It's basically plug and play. I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going. You don't need any other equipment to set it up. The sound is unbelievable...better than my Bose.,positive
754,5.0,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better,positive
755,5.0,"The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. .",positive
756,5.0,Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.,positive

759,5.0,"Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras. Great products. If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom, you can video talk with your kids by dropping in. Love it",positive
760,5.0,Got this for my wife for Christmas. Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt. Wife very happy. Avid amazon fan. Sound better then the echo.,positive
761,4.0,"Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion. If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale, you may not need the screen a much as you think. The sound quality is great.",positive
762,5.0,This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.,positive
763,5.0,"Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock, stereo, 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC), news/weather, audiobooks, and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times, but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories, but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands, and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance, but hey, this is still relatively new tech, and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago",positive
764,4.0,I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.,positive
765,5.0,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",positive
766,5.0,Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!,positive
767,5.0,"After researching and reading endless reviews, I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show. Once I had it home, it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one. Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts. So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option. I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful. Great addition to my other Echo devices.",positive
768,5.0,Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day.,positive
769,5.0,"I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.",positive
770,4.0,I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality. It does not link to direct tv.,positive
771,4.0,This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal.,positive
772,5.0,Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area. It is easy to use and to stay in touch. I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line.,positive

778,5.0,I have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything . I love it!,positive
779,5.0,We're hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family & friends as well as reading recipes etc.,positive
780,5.0,"So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However, this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it. It really is an amazing product!",positive
781,5.0,I will have one for all my rooms. I will also buy some for friends,positive

Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas.,positive
785,5.0,Amazon built upon the success of their Echo. I'm really enjoying the convenience of the Echo with the added display.,positive
786,4.0,I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices.,positive

788,5.0,The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .,positive
789,5.0,"The Amazon Echo Show is so much fun! I got it for my husband for Christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself! We also got hue lights and have set it up our routines. This show is so much fun! We listen to the news in the morning while making coffee, it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights, we listen to music while cooking dinner... cant recommend it more! Because of this purchase, I am also buying a spot! We love the camera feature where you can ""drop in"" so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras (for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog).",positive
790,5.0,Worked better than expected! Highly recommend the Echo Show,positive

795,5.0,"at first I wasnt sure if this was something I ""needed"" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I ""needed"" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone.",positive
796,5.0,Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember.,positive
797,5.0,"I control all my smart home sthings with it, and also have 2 echo dots",positive
798,5.0,"I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE",positive

800,5.0,With a Seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family.,positive
801,1.0,"Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.",negative
802,5.0,"I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol",positive
803,4.0,The Alexa show is a great product and the price was even better,positive

808,4.0,"Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know?",positive
809,4.0,"Works well with smart home lights, door locks and wireless security cam",positive
810,4.0,Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition.,positive
811,5.0,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.,positive
812,4.0,"I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table.",positive
813,5.0,I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa. I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App. Overall it is a great product!,positive
814,5.0,It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.,positive
815,4.0,"So having Alexa on hand could be good and bad. It's nice when I'm cooking and I need help with a recipe but it can be annoying when my kids fight over what they want Alexa to answer. Over all it's a nice product, connects to my Ring doorbell too which is nice.",positive
816,5.0,"The Echo show is addictive. Pairs easy, fantastic sound and video and once you download the Alexa app and learn a few things it becomes indispensable. Video calls work well. Great for the office or Kitchen.",positive

820,5.0,"This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking.",positive
821,4.0,Echo Show is a great tool in the kitchen. Paired with amazon music it makes the time go by quickly. Video selection could be better (somehow needs to strike a deal with Google for access to YouTube video). It does have nice video for recipes.,positive
822,5.0,"Amazon's Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast",positive

826,5.0,It is great to be able to make video calls from the kitchen. Very convenient.,positive
827,2.0,Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device.,negative
828,5.0,This was bought for a gift. But it looks nice. Just what was expected,positive
829,4.0,I have not used this as it is a gift for my parents. Will see how they like it.,positive

836,4.0,"The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other.",positive
837,4.0,"I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one.",positive
838,5.0,We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot,positive
839,2.0,"I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....",negative

842,4.0,"We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!",positive
843,4.0,"The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.",positive
844,4.0,Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!,positive

851,5.0,"I had been looking for the product for a while. After much research, I bought it and I am not disappointed. It is a great product. I can tell I won't be bored learning all that the echo show can do. If you're thinking about buying it, just go for it.",positive
852,5.0,"The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub.",positive
853,4.0,Like having pictures and weather on the screen and news up dates,positive
854,4.0,"It does everything amazon, and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo! It doesn't do Netflix, or Hulu, but that's okay. I really like the sound, it fills small rooms. It's easy now to video chat with Nana, or drop in to tell my kid's goodnight, when I am working late.",positive
855,5.0,Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices.,positive
856,5.0,I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video.,positive
857,5.0,"Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I'm a new customer there",positive
858,3.0,The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music. Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough. So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much.,negative
859,4.0,"Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment.",positive
860,4.0,Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.,positive
861,3.0,"Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion).",negative
862,5.0,We are loving it so far! Bought with a great deal and was able to use previous best buy awards to get it cheap. We also ended up buying another one for the parents for Christmas so we can chat back and forth! I love how all the echo's connect now in our home.,positive
863,5.0,I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.,positive

867,4.0,We have Alexa and now a video version of recipes and more. Love it!,positive
868,5.0,"Ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff, but to be honest Alexa has been great, not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking, or being able to multi task much easier, it fit in seamlessly with our home security system, added a extra cam, and really does add something extra to the home",positive
869,5.0,Video integration it's big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who's at the door when doorbell rings.,positive
870,5.0,The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up,positive
871,5.0,I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine,positive
872,5.0,The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.,positive
873,5.0,"I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.",positive
874,4.0,Added screen a great features visual effect a plus,positive
875,5.0,We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews,positive
876,4.0,"I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future.",positive
877,5.0,This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.,positive
878,5.0,"I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn't allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that.",positive
879,5.0,I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies.,positive

881,5.0,The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great!,positive
882,5.0,The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.,positive
883,5.0,Product is great. It is Easy to use and easy to set up,positive
884,5.0,"This is a helpful addition to the home. It's great to be able to set timers, play music, and check the news all hands free.",positive
885,4.0,Alexa can make you crazy but it‚Äôs worth the aggravation.,positive
886,3.0,"This does the same things as the other echos but has a screen. The sound is comparable to the echo which is good. The screen is small, not hd, and not touch screen. You only can call other echo users.If you have an echo don't run out and buy you can do all on a laptop. If you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,",negative
887,5.0,Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.,positive
888,4.0,Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos,positive
889,5.0,"First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice.",positive
890,4.0,Great product will recommend it to friends and family.,positive
891,5.0,"I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful",positive
892,5.0,The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away,positive
893,5.0,"This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke.",positive
894,5.0,great product with many functions I would highly recommend it to a friend.,positive
895,4.0,Device must be studied and practiced with to gain max use of its robust capacity .,positive
896,3.0,"We bought the Echo Show to get the hyped benefits of Alexa, and home automation. After using for a week, we decided to return the Echo Show. Alexa just isn't ready for prime time. 90% of the time we got the ""I can't answer that"" response to questions. It's a waste of money for us. Say ""Alexa, Say good bye!""",negative
897,5.0,This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo. It provides better sound quality and plays video. Pairing this off with Nest cameras has been the best. So quick and easy. I highly recommend this product.,positive
898,5.0,"Alexa can do it all! Having a severe hearing loss, the 'Show' gives me visuals along with captions so that I can follow what Alexa is saying!",positive

It is a great device. I use the drop in feature to communicate with others in the house, especially when they are upstairs, without having to yell. The smart hub is amazing.

1148,5.0,"I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs.",positive

Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next. Great customer service!!! Thank you!!",positive
1161,4.0,"Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided, I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound, look, etc perspective really didn't lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for 'free' was a smart move.Overall, I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects.",positive

1172,2.0,I really like the echo plus and the hue light bulb does work on the echo plus but I had to buy a bridge from Phillips in order to schedule on off schedule times for the light. I thought the Echo Plus was like a bridge but I guess it isn‚Äôt.,negative

1197,5.0,"From her jokes, rapping and everyday new fact Alexa is awesome. Its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day. But every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week. There are tons of skills for Alexa most useful some random. But shes a must try. Also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces. You can just buy some compatible smart bulbs.",positive

1433,5.0,I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don't know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service.,positive

I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further.

My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.",positive

1667,5.0,"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price",positive

1671,5.0,"Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.",positive

Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet.

The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.",negative

Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",negative
1736,5.0,"My wife loves to read, but she was always hesitant to try ebooks. She used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book. I talked her into it by telling her its lighter, easier to hold, can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it. But she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back. She also found out that Amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing, namely classics and such...I think. If you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version. The LED's are a nice touch.",positive

1864,4.0,"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned.",positive

1876,5.0,"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.",positive

1880,5.0,"Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week.",positive

My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child.

1950,5.0,"I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this.",positive

1962,4.0,I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it.

The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.,positive

1969,5.0,"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.",positive

PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2",positive

Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet.",positive
2014,5.0,I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.,positive
2015,5.0,"It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate.

We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi.

2034,5.0,"Great tablet for kids. Big choice of apps, great price.",positive
2035,4.0,I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.,positive
2036,5.0,Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great,positive
2037,4.0,"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent.",positive

2041,4.0,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.",positive
2042,4.0,"Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better.",positive

2046,4.0,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.",positive

2048,4.0,"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store.",positive

I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids.",negative
2064,5.0,"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.",positive

2071,4.0,"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic.",positive
2072,5.0,"I love to read but don't have the space to keep a collection of books. For me, this Kindle is the best of both worlds. I can enjoy reading a good book without having to find shelf space to store it later.",positive

2085,4.0,"I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase.

2166,4.0,"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",positive

However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine.",positive
2210,4.0,"It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it.",positive

2229,4.0,"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great",positive

2249,4.0,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.,positive

2364,4.0,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",positive
2365,5.0,Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each,positive

2368,5.0,"I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile.",positive
2369,5.0,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional.

2370,5.0,We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.,positive
2371,4.0,"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent.",positive
2372,4.0,"Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps.",positive
2373,5.0,"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service.

Great choice for kids.",positive

That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5.",positive

2383,5.0,"My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case.",positive
2384,5.0,"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!",positive

2465,5.0,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",positive
2466,3.0,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,negative
2467,5.0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.,positive

2484,1.0,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",negative

2634,5.0,"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.",positive

The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.",positive
2643,5.0,Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.,positive
2644,5.0,Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also,positive

2654,4.0,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much.",positive
2655,4.0,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
2656,5.0,I was unable to find a new Kindle in-store and was excited to find Best Buy had them online and I could purchase it and have it delivered simply and easily.,positive
2657,3.0,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,negative
2658,5.0,"I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue. They was for my 5 and 7 years children. They really love their tablets. Yes, it was a birthday gift.",positive

2678,5.0,"Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot.",positive
2679,2.0,I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.,negative
2680,5.0,"This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety.",positive

2687,5.0,"I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it.",positive
2688,4.0,Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.,positive
2689,5.0,This is the best purchase I've mad in a tablet my daughter loves it,positive
2690,5.0,"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!",positive
2691,5.0,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.,positive
2692,5.0,"My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints.",positive
2693,5.0,Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet,positive
2694,4.0,"this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids.",positive
2695,5.0,Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.,positive
2696,4.0,"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk.",positive
2697,5.0,purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software,positive
2698,4.0,It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android,positive

2703,5.0,So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.,positive
2704,4.0,"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue.",positive

2707,4.0,Good product for a young child to play with without breaking,positive
2708,4.0,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.,positive
2709,4.0,Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi,positive
2710,1.0,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor,negative

2725,4.0,"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far.",positive
2726,3.0,"bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective. the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible. comes in 4 different color. was 16gb enough space for kids, has camera, ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids",negative

2729,4.0,"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken.",positive
2730,5.0,I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.,positive
2731,5.0,It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.,positive
2732,5.0,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!,positive
2733,3.0,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.",negative
2734,5.0,I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..,positive
2735,5.0,"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance.

2736,5.0,It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty...,positive
2737,5.0,"I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them.",positive
2738,4.0,We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.,positive
2739,5.0,It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!,positive
2740,5.0,"I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it.

2751,5.0,I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,positive

2755,5.0,Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.,positive
2756,4.0,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!",positive

2770,5.0,"I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it",positive
2771,5.0,Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes!,positive
2772,4.0,The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that,positive

2774,5.0,This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.,positive
2775,5.0,I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.,positive
2776,5.0,"Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case.",positive

2784,5.0,"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!",positive
2785,5.0,"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.",positive

2791,4.0,"Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen.",positive
2792,5.0,"Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them.",positive
2793,5.0,The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.,positive

2803,5.0,Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.,positive
2804,3.0,"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it.",negative
2805,4.0,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.",positive
2806,5.0,This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.,positive
2807,5.0,"Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use.",positive

2812,4.0,"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff.",positive
2813,5.0,I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps,positive

2817,4.0,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch.

2852,4.0,We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume.

I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all",negative

2917,4.0,"Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.",positive

The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not.

It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.",positive
2993,3.0,"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.",negative
2994,4.0,I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.,positive
2995,5.0,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.",positive
2996,4.0,Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.,positive
2997,5.0,Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!,positive
2998,4.0,I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!,positive
2999,5.0,These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!,positive
3000,5.0,Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the Alexa feature I listen to Kindle books that are not available as audio books,positive
3001,5.0,good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.,positive
3002,4.0,If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.,positive
3003,5.0,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",positive
3004,4.0,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.,positive
3005,5.0,Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.,positive
3006,5.0,"Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him",positive
3007,5.0,"great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.",positive
3008,5.0,"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!",positive
3009,5.0,Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!,positive
3010,5.0,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",positive
3011,5.0,Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up,positive
3012,4.0,Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.,positive
3013,5.0,We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.,positive
3014,4.0,"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.",positive
3015,4.0,"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.",positive
3016,5.0,"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.",positive
3017,5.0,Great product for when you are on the go.great sound,positive
3018,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!",positive
3019,1.0,"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79",negative

3023,4.0,"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice.",positive
3024,5.0,"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands‚Ä¶you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",positive
3025,5.0,"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.",positive
3026,3.0,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.",negative
3027,5.0,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",positive
3028,5.0,The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,positive
3029,4.0,"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",positive
3030,2.0,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.,negative
3031,5.0,purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.,positive
3032,5.0,"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.",positive
3033,4.0,Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.,positive
3034,4.0,"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options",positive
3035,5.0,Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.,positive
3036,5.0,This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.,positive
3037,4.0,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,positive
3038,5.0,The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it,positive
3039,5.0,The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.,positive
3040,5.0,Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.,positive
3041,3.0,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,negative
3042,5.0,"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!",positive
3043,5.0,"I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.",positive

3046,5.0,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",positive

3048,5.0,Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions,positive

3050,4.0,"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo.",positive
3051,5.0,This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it,positive

3061,4.0,"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!",positive
3062,4.0,"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.",positive
3063,4.0,The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.,positive
3064,1.0,"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear",negative

3066,5.0,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,positive

3070,5.0,"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it.",positive
3071,5.0,This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it,positive
3072,5.0,Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.,positive
3073,5.0,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",positive
3074,5.0,This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.,positive
3075,5.0,It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends,positive
3076,5.0,I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.,positive
3077,5.0,"Has great sound, clarity,alexia has great responses",positive
3078,5.0,"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.",positive
3079,3.0,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",negative
3080,3.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,negative
3081,4.0,I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack,positive
3082,4.0,"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen.",positive
3083,2.0,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution.",negative
3084,5.0,"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!",positive
3085,2.0,"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """,negative
3086,5.0,Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.,positive
3087,5.0,"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift.",positive
3088,4.0,I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing,positive
3089,5.0,"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one.",positive
3090,4.0,The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.,positive
3091,5.0,I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!,positive
3092,5.0,"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.",positive

3097,3.0,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,negative
3098,5.0,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.",positive

3109,5.0,"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!",positive
3110,4.0,"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.",positive
3111,5.0,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",positive
3112,5.0,"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot.",positive

3116,5.0,Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.,positive
3117,5.0,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,positive
3118,4.0,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap,positive
3119,3.0,"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa",negative
3120,5.0,I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.,positive

3134,4.0,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well.

3136,5.0,"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.",positive

3139,5.0,I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.,positive
3140,5.0,"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want.",positive
3141,4.0,"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming",positive
3142,5.0,"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.",positive
3143,5.0,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,positive
3144,2.0,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.",negative
3145,4.0,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.",positive
3146,4.0,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,positive
3147,4.0,I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,positive
3148,3.0,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,negative
3149,4.0,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.",positive
3150,5.0,Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.,positive
3151,4.0,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.,positive
3152,5.0,"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously.",positive
3153,5.0,Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.,positive
3154,2.0,"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund",negative
3155,2.0,I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.,negative
3156,5.0,I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.,positive
3157,4.0,"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.",positive
3158,5.0,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy,positive
3159,4.0,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.",positive
3160,5.0,"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...",positive
3161,5.0,"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.",positive
3162,4.0,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.",positive
3163,5.0,Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!,positive
3164,1.0,Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,negative
3165,4.0,I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.,positive
3166,5.0,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,positive
3167,5.0,I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.,positive
3168,5.0,Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,positive
3169,5.0,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked,positive
3170,3.0,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",negative
3171,5.0,"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.",positive
3172,5.0,"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!",positive
3173,4.0,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",positive
3174,4.0,"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.",positive
3175,5.0,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,positive
3176,5.0,"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.",positive
3177,4.0,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats",positive
3178,5.0,It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station,positive
3179,5.0,This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.,positive
3180,5.0,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,positive
3181,4.0,"Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist.....",positive
3182,5.0,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.",positive
3183,4.0,Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.,positive
3184,4.0,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.",positive
3185,5.0,Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price,positive
3186,5.0,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",positive
3187,4.0,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,positive
3188,5.0,I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.,positive
3189,5.0,"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.",positive
3190,4.0,Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.,positive
3191,5.0,"Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!",positive
3192,5.0,"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge.",positive
3193,4.0,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.",positive
3194,4.0,We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.,positive
3195,5.0,"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.",positive
3196,5.0,Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.,positive
3197,5.0,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",positive
3198,5.0,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,positive
3199,5.0,i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.,positive
3200,5.0,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,positive
3201,3.0,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",negative
3202,4.0,Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa,positive
3203,5.0,My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.,positive
3204,5.0,Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.,positive
3205,4.0,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift,positive
3206,5.0,"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.",positive
3207,5.0,"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking.",positive
3208,5.0,Great tech works well highly recommended no issues,positive
3209,5.0,Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.,positive
3210,4.0,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",positive
3211,5.0,I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.,positive
3212,5.0,"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",positive

3216,4.0,Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine.,positive
3217,5.0,Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites,positive
3218,5.0,"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",positive

After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)",positive

3248,5.0,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading.

My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",positive
3277,1.0,"I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",negative

3285,5.0,My sister told me about the Kindle Fire and I wanted one so she said she bought hers from Best Buy.,positive
3286,5.0,Sales guy didn't have much knowledge about the Kindle. He wasn't very helpful in getting me started.,positive
3287,5.0,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",positive
3288,5.0,Want a port for addition memory this model had it!,positive
3289,5.0,"This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability",positive
3290,3.0,For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak,negative
3291,5.0,I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book,positive
3292,4.0,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.",positive
3293,5.0,"This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa.",positive
3294,5.0,Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase,positive
3295,5.0,"I love it!! It can do it all!! Beautiful color graphics and in no time at all, I can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel. I love it!!",positive
3296,5.0,"I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.",positive
3297,4.0,I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars,positive
3298,5.0,"very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price",positive
3299,5.0,Nice tablet and very fast/capable. The storage options are way better than the previous models. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone in the market for one.,positive
3300,5.0,Easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,positive
3301,5.0,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! You can't beat it for the price!,positive
3302,5.0,Very nice. Easy to use. Got it to use with Amazon prime. Great combo.,positive
3303,5.0,"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!",positive
3304,5.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is.",positive
3305,5.0,"Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it. Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising.",positive
3306,5.0,Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers,positive
3307,4.0,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.",positive
3308,5.0,Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.,positive
3309,5.0,I really like the auto on off feature. Volume control could be more ergonomic.,positive
3310,4.0,This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good. All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy.,positive
3311,5.0,"I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot.",positive
3312,3.0,"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.",negative
3313,5.0,"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.",positive
3314,5.0,"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.",positive
3315,5.0,"Second kindle I use it for reading,games,internet,and shopping",positive
3316,4.0,Love Amazon however their tablet limits you to using their browser and their apps. Go online and you can get around them and download google and the playstore. Made my Fire into regular android tablet. Much happier now.,positive
3317,4.0,My wife really enjoys the amazon fire. Has very good picture quality. Very easy to figure out how to use because its similar to our smart phone.,positive
3318,5.0,"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have.",positive
3319,5.0,"I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.",positive
3320,5.0,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",positive
3321,5.0,"The Amazon Fire tablets are nice tablets. They're especially great for streaming tv and movies. And since it's a Kindle it's great for books too. It is a little odd with the Internet browser, and still a little limited in the app store. But overall a great little tablet.",positive
3322,5.0,"I got this for my mom to use as her ""computer"" and I am so happy with it. It's ease of use and ability to store pics for my mom is a big plus. Thanks !!!!",positive
3323,5.0,"Love how user friendly the Kindle Fire is, for any age..",positive
3324,5.0,My husband is up in years & really enjoys spending time on his Kindle. He had a smaller one & it gave out on him so this one is ideal. He spends hours on it & has hours of fun!!!,positive
3325,5.0,makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.,positive
3326,4.0,I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great!,positive
3327,4.0,"The Amazon tablet series has come along way since it first came out. The screen on the Fire HD 10 is stunning. Clear and easy to read. If used to android apps though, may be disappointed that some of your favorite apps will not be available on this tablet.",positive
3328,4.0,"Love my new kindle, thought the screen would be too large but after using it a few days, all is good. Very thin , got a case for it, I now feel at home with it. Do not like the ""new"" lock screen lock to open the tablet at all, its tiny and hard to ""unlock"" most always taking several times to swipe it just right.",positive
3329,5.0,"Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it.",positive
3330,5.0,Great tablet! New to me so I have a lot to learn about it's functions.,positive
3331,5.0,This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.,positive
3332,4.0,Employees were very helpful. I always enjoy shopping at Best Buy.,positive
3333,5.0,Even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets I didn't really notice it. I like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and TV.,positive
3334,5.0,Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.,positive
3335,5.0,I would be happy to give it as Christmas gifts to many of the people I know. I love the size of the screen. A charge last and the Bluetooth sinks well with the wireless keyboard. It's almost as good as I IPad.,positive
3336,5.0,"Great size, easy to use and it has a sleek look that is attractive.",positive
3337,5.0,The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It's nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well!,positive
3338,5.0,"Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer.",positive
3339,5.0,Very nice people and good product. I would buy from again.,positive
3340,5.0,Easy to set up. Good size tablet. Like the addition of Alexa,positive
3341,5.0,"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.",positive
3342,5.0,"so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one....",positive
3343,4.0,"Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality.",positive
3344,4.0,"I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.",positive
3345,5.0,this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...,positive
3346,5.0,"I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version",positive
3347,4.0,"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this.",positive
3348,3.0,Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.,negative
3349,5.0,"I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit.",positive
3350,3.0,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.",negative
3351,5.0,"Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions.",positive
3352,4.0,The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.,positive
3353,5.0,This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great.,positive
3354,5.0,This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.,positive
3355,5.0,"Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area). Sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!",positive
3356,5.0,Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.,positive
3357,4.0,"Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly!",positive
3358,5.0,"Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space",positive
3359,5.0,The best kindle that I ever had!It is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book.Great for indoor and outdoor reading,positive
3360,5.0,I would recommend this product. It works great and ver compact.,positive
3361,5.0,"This is my third Kindle and the best one yet. Love the new controls, the backlit page, the compact size and the ease of use. I would recommend the Kindle Voyage to all readers!",positive
3362,5.0,The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage.,positive
3363,5.0,I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.,positive
3364,4.0,Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.,positive
3365,5.0,"It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level.",positive
3366,5.0,"I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device.",positive
3367,5.0,bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it,positive
3368,5.0,"Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience.",positive
3369,4.0,I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.,positive
3370,5.0,"So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc.",positive
3371,4.0,"I bought this game for my son, and he loves it..it is very entertaining.",positive
3372,5.0,"Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun...",positive
3373,4.0,Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.,positive
3374,4.0,"Really like the Kindle. The screen is very easy on the eyes, much better for reading than my Ipad!.",positive
3375,5.0,Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.,positive
3376,5.0,"One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)",positive
3377,5.0,What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.,positive
3378,5.0,"excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different (I adore the flatness so much), and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. IMO, worth the cost",positive
3379,5.0,Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it.,positive
3380,5.0,"This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.",positive

3384,4.0,"This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks.",positive
3385,5.0,"I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly.",positive
3386,5.0,The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability.,positive
3387,5.0,"Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best, you won't be disappointed.",positive
3388,4.0,"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.",positive
3389,5.0,I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.,positive
3390,5.0,We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.,positive
3391,5.0,I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.,positive
3392,5.0,"I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page.",positive

3397,5.0,New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage.,positive
3398,5.0,why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now!,positive
3399,5.0,I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn't go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons.,positive
3400,5.0,I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.,positive
3401,4.0,"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.",positive
3402,5.0,Gave this to my wife for Christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle. She loves it.,positive
3403,4.0,"I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own.",positive
3404,3.0,Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.,negative
3405,4.0,Went back and forth between this and the Oasis but in the end just couldn't justify the added cost. So far I'm happy with this model.,positive
3406,5.0,This is my third one of these and this is the best one by far.,positive
3407,5.0,"This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it.",positive
3408,5.0,"This readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag. Easy to use, controls for children are very effective. Am glad I bought it.",positive
3409,3.0,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.,negative
3410,5.0,"My first ebook reader. Read some reviews, decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light. Sometimes I have to adjust the light manually but no biggie, quick and easy on the eyes.",positive
3411,5.0,"We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent.",positive
3412,4.0,Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small,positive
3413,5.0,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.,positive
3414,4.0,"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.",positive
3415,5.0,Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it.,positive
3416,5.0,Works as expected. Very easy to use and does not hurt my eyes like a tablet would.,positive
3417,5.0,I bought this as a gift. I think it is pretty decent both quality and design.,positive
3418,5.0,"It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks.",positive
3419,1.0,"My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",negative
3420,5.0,I had been reading books on my iPad for years and finally broke down to get a kindle. It's exactly what I hoped. The screen is easy to read in any light. It's a light weight and size and easy to stow away in a small bag.,positive
3421,5.0,This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.,positive
3422,5.0,"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.",positive
3423,4.0,"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one.",positive
3424,5.0,outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2,positive

3426,4.0,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.",positive
3427,5.0,I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!,positive
3428,5.0,"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!",positive
3429,1.0,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",negative
3430,5.0,I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well,positive
3431,4.0,"I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads.",positive

3442,5.0,Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend,positive
3443,4.0,Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder,positive
3444,5.0,I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .,positive
3445,5.0,"I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need!",positive
3446,1.0,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.,negative
3447,5.0,"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely.",positive
3448,4.0,"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying.",positive
3449,5.0,Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.,positive

3480,5.0,"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies"".",positive

3487,4.0,This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.,positive
3488,4.0,"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.",positive
3489,5.0,"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading",positive

3495,3.0,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past.",negative
3496,4.0,"We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value.",positive
3497,4.0,"I've had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately.

3545,4.0,"Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard.",positive
3546,5.0,"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",positive

3566,4.0,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal.",positive
3567,5.0,"My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch.",positive
3568,4.0,Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.,positive
3569,5.0,My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away,positive

3582,4.0,"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing.

Would recommend.",positive

3602,4.0,"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.",positive

3688,5.0,I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer.

3693,5.0,bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for,positive
3694,4.0,"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!",positive
3695,4.0,"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs",positive
3696,5.0,"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life.",positive
3697,5.0,Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.,positive
3698,3.0,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.,negative

3705,5.0,Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.,positive
3706,5.0,"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead.",positive
3707,5.0,This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.,positive
3708,5.0,Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.,positive

3715,4.0,"Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price",positive
3716,5.0,"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking.",positive
3717,4.0,So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.,positive

3728,5.0,Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.,positive
3729,5.0,"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!",positive
3730,5.0,Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.,positive
3731,5.0,We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly.,positive
3732,4.0,"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps",positive
3733,3.0,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire,negative

3814,2.0,"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!",negative
3815,5.0,"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)",positive
3816,5.0,Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.,positive

3818,5.0,Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!,positive
3819,2.0,This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.,negative
3820,5.0,"my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger",positive
3821,5.0,I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.,positive

3827,4.0,"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games.",positive
3828,4.0,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.",positive
3829,5.0,The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.,positive
3830,5.0,"bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features...",positive
3831,5.0,"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card.",positive
3832,5.0,"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!",positive
3833,5.0,I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.,positive
3834,5.0,I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download.,positive
3835,4.0,Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.,positive

3839,5.0,I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it,positive
3840,5.0,whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
3841,5.0,"I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift.",positive
3842,4.0,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,positive

3849,4.0,I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.,positive
3850,4.0,My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.,positive
3851,5.0,"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones.",positive
3852,5.0,Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages,positive
3853,5.0,"Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage",positive

3856,5.0,Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.,positive
3857,5.0,Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size.,positive
3858,4.0,"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",positive
3859,5.0,Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.,positive
3860,5.0,"For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase.",positive

3867,5.0,I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.,positive
3868,4.0,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.",positive
3869,5.0,"Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now.",positive
3870,5.0,"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption.",positive

She loves it!",positive
3874,5.0,"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet.",positive

3878,5.0,"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?",positive

3884,5.0,Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy.,positive
3885,5.0,"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device.",positive

3892,5.0,"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price.",positive
3893,5.0,Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).,positive
3894,4.0,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.,positive
3895,5.0,"Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits.",positive

3941,5.0,"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets.

3989,5.0,"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.",positive

4029,5.0,Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.,positive

4031,4.0,I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.,positive

4038,5.0,"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus.",positive

Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00.

4051,4.0,Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size,positive
4052,5.0,I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!,positive

4054,4.0,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.",positive

4064,5.0,"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD).

4066,5.0,Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders,positive
4067,5.0,It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.,positive
4068,5.0,"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome.",positive

4074,5.0,Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.,positive
4075,3.0,"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.",negative

If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.",positive

4100,5.0,"I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos.

The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books.

4339,4.0,"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere.",positive

4451,5.0,I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted.

Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books.

4640,1.0,I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.,negative
4641,4.0,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools.",positive

4688,5.0,This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner.

4691,5.0,"Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train.",positive
4692,4.0,"This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite.",positive
4693,4.0,"I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light",positive

4719,5.0,I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.,positive
4720,5.0,this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,positive
4721,3.0,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed.

4733,5.0,"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps.",positive

He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows.

Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",negative
4753,4.0,This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.,positive
4754,5.0,Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.,positive

4756,5.0,"I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things.",positive

4761,1.0,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",negative
4762,5.0,lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle,positive
4763,5.0,BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.,positive
4764,5.0,"Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader.",positive
4765,5.0,This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.,positive
4766,5.0,"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.",positive
4767,5.0,The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case,positive
4768,5.0,Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking,positive
4769,5.0,"This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it, I wouldn't buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small.",positive
4770,5.0,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",positive
4771,5.0,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",positive
4772,5.0,"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!",positive
4773,5.0,Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.,positive
4774,4.0,Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.,positive
4775,5.0,Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.,positive
4776,5.0,"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go.",positive
4777,5.0,"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",positive

4779,4.0,I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.,positive
4780,5.0,Was a gift to replace older one and she really likes this one. Light and the battery last much longer.,positive
4781,5.0,"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",positive
4782,5.0,"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",positive
4783,5.0,"It fits easily into smallest purse so it's always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. Lightweight, especially without the case. Shape of back provides easy grip. Accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. Would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate, but that's a minor thing.",positive
4784,5.0,"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all.",positive
4785,5.0,"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go.",positive

I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point.",positive
4793,5.0,"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",positive

4870,5.0,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",positive
4871,4.0,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",positive
4872,4.0,"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",positive

5007,5.0,"At first I thought it would be just another one of the voice interfaces that are on a lot of devices - It only comes with a few functions. Wow I never was so happy to be proved wrong. The omni-directional microphones and excellent sound alone make it a great choice to add to your home. Because of its open source code you can add skills that other users have developed or download a SDK and make your own. It reads me bedtime stories filters my content for news sources according to my whim add complex sums, spells and is an all around good sport. But the best thing is -- I had a few remote control hubs around wink, nest the house because I hoped they would make my life easier only to find the they cell phone user interface made it much more cumbersome than completing the task myself. Echo changed all that it unified my security, locks, my lights and more through an easy voice interface -- I could not be more happy - it gave me more than a smart house - it gave me a smart home. I even bought a second unit to take on vacation- Definitely will change your life for the better",positive

5024,5.0,We have a lot of fun with the music asking questions Great tool,positive
5025,5.0,"I am very pleased with the purchase. I use Alexa to listen to my favorite TuneIn radio station in a foreign country, set timers when I'm cooking, ask the time in different cities in the world or basic culture questions. She responds to everything. If I want to play music, she will default to Amazon Prime. If you have the membership, it is very convenient to have Alexa. I have even placed orders on Amazon with my voice. I also have Hue lights so Alexa is the one turning off my house lights at the end of the day...ah, and I can ask her to do so from the upstairs level. I think this purchase is one of the best I've made this year. I am sure there is much more to tap on (no pun intended), and I'll find out as I use Echo more. For now, I totally recommend.",positive
5026,5.0,"Once this is hooked up to your wifi it is a great little product. I tried hooking it up on my computer but it went much more easily on my smart phone. You can ask it almost anything and she will respond. Plays music tell you jokes, etc. You will have to subscribe to a music service. Pandora is free as are many other services. Once subscribed you just have to ask her to play your favorite music and it will play all day! Oh it can also be used as an alarm to wake you up each morning.",positive
5027,5.0,"I bought this on impulse because I had heard great things about it. I have a variety of automated home devices, such as Philips Hue bulbs, and wanted to see if the Echo would help me control everything.I now use the Echo all the time for lights, alarms, and daily news. The best part of the Echo is its ability to recognize multiple voices at different volumes. My parents also use it and have been considering getting one for their home!The best app to use with Alexa is IFTTT. You can have IFTTT add things to Google lists and calendars, trigger find your phone, create custom light settings for smart bulbs, and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency. These features are all great for me since I live by myself. I definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen. Echo skills also expand the use of Alexa by adding trivia games, recipe apps, and searching for hotels, flights, and movies. One of my favorites is Milo, which allows you to search for movies or tv and find where it is offered on multiple services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.The only downside I have found is you have to be very specific with some commands, such as which music service you want to access or triggering IFTTT. But Amazon has recently updated the Alexa settings with the ability to change Spotify to your default music player, so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed!If you have connected home devices or live by yourself I would definitely recommend the Echo! I have had no issues with it and it helps me everyday!",positive
5028,4.0,"Bought the Echo to use with my Alarm.com security system as a voice recognition interface. Did not expect to see my friends and family also buy one for other reasons. Great product, price too high!",positive
5029,4.0,Best that is out there at this time.would like if you were able to connect to Bose speaker with Bluetooth.,positive
5030,5.0,"I live alone, so I got this so I could hear another voice. I've got it programmed to play music from my era. It sounds great. I love it !",positive
5031,5.0,"Echo works flawlessly, its voice recognition to respond to requests is great. Just purchased a second one for the upstairs.",positive
5032,2.0,We returned this item after 2 weeks. It took a lot of repeated request to get it to listen to us and it just wasn't as easy to use as I thought it would be.,negative
5033,5.0,Funny thing since Steve Jobs has passed away techies have been waiting for the next great thing from apple and sadly its more of the same well Amazon did all techies a favor with this invention something Apple should have done with Siri but didn't. Hands free Alexa who hears your command 99 percent of the time instead of 50 haha aka Siri. Team this up with a smart hub like Phillip lightbulbs and a nest system and a harmony hub and you living like Ironman.,positive
5034,4.0,I got this to give voice activation to a Phillips Hue,positive
5035,4.0,So far we like this. We've not really had a lot of luck with linking to both of our phones. I really like the grocery shopping and to do list features. VERY helpful. I'm sure there is a lot more it will do that we will figure out in time.,positive
5036,5.0,"This is a great item to own in your home. So you can entertain friends, family, and yourself!!!",positive
5037,5.0,Pros: Controls the lights in our house and integrated seamlessly with the wemo app. Plays music well and sounds great as a Bluetooth speaker. We are even able to add groceries via a 3rd party app (OurGroceries).Cons: Some of the commands are a bit of a mouthful and if you don't say the command in the proper order and in a timely manner Alexa will not understand. It would be nice if you could change the default built in lists and to dos to a 3rd party app to make the commands a little easier.Overall: A little expensive for a gadget but the home automation is really fun!,positive
5038,5.0,I liked this item so much that I purchased 2 more as Xmas presents.,positive
5039,5.0,We added this as part of our kitchen remodel and love its functionality,positive
5040,5.0,"The Amazon Echo provides great sound quality with no fuss. Just say ""Alexa play me some music"" and voila!!!Set up is easy.",positive
5041,5.0,The Echo is an excellent product and gives out excellent clear loud sound. This was a great buy! You can ask Alexa to do anything from songs to buy on Amazon etc. thanks best buy for all your help!,positive
5042,4.0,"Echo seems well engineered. The voice response is very natural and usually understands what I'm saying. Echo wouldn't connect to my home WiFi because I had two networks with the same SSIDs (one 2.4ghz and one 5ghz). Once I changed the name (SSID) of one of the networks, Echo connected right up and hasn't had any trouble since. Because of the WiFi issue, I took 1 star away.",positive
5043,5.0,Takes a little to figure out all the things echo can do.thinking about buying one for the bedroom.,positive
5044,5.0,Have enjoyed it since we set it up the first night. Kids love to ask random questions every morning and the jokes are actually funny.,positive
5045,5.0,"I purchased this for my wife after she had seen one at a friends house. She loves it! It stays in the kitchen and she listens to music, sets cooking timers, gets weather reports and overall just enjoys it. It works flawlessly and is great entertainment for our grandson too! I would recommend this to anyone!",positive
5046,5.0,Did not think I would like this product. I now own two!,positive
5047,5.0,Alexa is working well and learning more every day.,positive
5048,5.0,Best Birthday present I ever got... I have my lights set up using Alexa and thermostat.. Also use the shopping list everyday helps to remember when I am at the store shopping.. love playing millions of trivia games and all the information she gives all day.. also love the many new apps added almost ever day... I Love my Alexa I highly recommend it!!,positive
5049,5.0,I love Alexa! She keeps me informed on the weather.r.,positive
5050,5.0,"I love it, very easy to use and so much information so readily available. It's limitless to what it can be used for, from a radio to encyclopedia with no effort and no set up.",positive
5051,5.0,"And never talks back. This is the best product out there to demonstrate just what technology can do for the average person, and it is constantly updated.every home should have one!",positive
5052,4.0,"Great to set timers, play music, look up scores, etc. I wish it could access my weather app (dark sky) when I asked about rain to give me a more precise answer.",positive
5053,5.0,Awesome speaker and home automation control. Very recommended.,positive
5054,3.0,"Alexa is great when asking about the weather, or when wanting to play some music quickly. However, majority of the questions I ask it cannot find. I think that the questions are pretty simple too. She will answer questions with direct answers like ""whats 2+2"" but if you go much further she wont respond.",negative
5055,4.0,"The Amazon Echo is everything it is advertised to bed. The voice recognition is very good - it understands commands from every family member, even when our speech patterns are very different. The variety of skills is impressive. We have been using our Echo for a month, and have only begun to unlock its capability.",positive
5056,3.0,"It was fun for few weeks until my kids starting asking all sorts of questions to Alexa. Amazon released a smaller version of Echo called Amazon DOT. Which is for half the price of Echo. DOT doesn't have speaker like Echo. But for people who are not playing music through Amazon Echo, DOT might be the way to go",negative
5057,5.0,"its great, i hooked my amazon prime up to it, that is the best",positive
5058,5.0,What a cool gadget. Great to have by the pool and change music without getting out.,positive
5059,5.0,You will use and enjoy this every day. It's a wide open connection that will amaze and surprise you.,positive
5060,4.0,"It's fun for the family to use Echo. Alexa has been of help to answer questions that the kids ask, many times related to their homework. Also, works great with 3rd party products, like Nest's. Will keep getting better and better over time, as more content/ data and integration becomes available for Alexa.",positive
5061,5.0,Great app with lot of features. Sound is ok for the small size,positive
5062,5.0,"Great little gadget, works well with my smart home. I can now turn on lights, etc. with voice commands. Feels like Star Trek! Love how Alexa plays music as well, and she understands most commands. It's fun to have a digital assistant around!",positive
5063,4.0,"Good product overall. I used it mainly to control smart switches (WEMO), ecobee, in addition to all the other ""smart things"" you can do. Having an IFTTT account is definitely helpful and compatible with certain products. Not compatible with Chamberlin MyQ Garage wifi opener.",positive
5064,4.0,I haven't finished setting this up. But the demo section explains how to setup. Alexa seems ready to follow the commands.,positive
5065,5.0,"The future is here, the best voice recognition I've ever used, along with intelligence and responsiveness.",positive
5066,5.0,"Great add on to any home. Alexia is nice to answer questions, play your music, or about anything you can think of.",positive
5067,5.0,"I bought this just to listen to music with my daughter but I use so much more, shopping lists, reminders, timers etc. I recommend anyone to get one",positive
5068,4.0,Echo performs well when she understands the question asked. I find myself often repeating questions because Alexa doesn't get it right.,positive
5069,5.0,Echo-Dot is doing the same thing. Just doesn't have the huge speaker.Echo-Dot can be connected to external speakers via blue-tooth or cable (though it's speakers are not bad for voice responses from it),positive
5070,4.0,"First and foremost the Echo is a good Bluetooth/connected speaker. It's no Sonos but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's really cool to ask her questions like you would a real person and get some good results. ""When is the cubs game/how are they doing"" and ""What are show times for Star Trek: Beyond"" yielded great results. To be honest though that novelty while very good and consistent wears off a little. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't invested in smart home tech because that is where the Echo shines. I currently have an Ecobee3, Phillips Hue, Sonos, August lock, and Harmony Hub. Right now the Echo works with Hue, Sonos, and Ecobee3 with the Harmony Hub being tested currently. There is no way to make the August work but there are ways to make other things work using apps like IFTT and Yonomi. I suggest anyone who wants one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing things you can do with this awesome little device. I can turn on and off my lights, turn on and off my different activities with Harmony, play music, lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web. It's really cool and we are closer to Star Trek than ever. It is worth the money if you want to talk to your house. I love it. There are some failings. It doesn't understand some complex wordy questions while others it has no problem with. The list of compatible devices are limited but with those two apps I spoke of, IFTT and Yonomi that list is greatly increased, and the ""skills' you can get aren't good at all. Limited and poor. But the potential is there and it looks like Amazon is working on it.",positive
5071,4.0,So far it is really cool. If your big on Amazon shopping. Also Alexa understands what I'm saying. Alexa is always getting better every week. Love how it plays music for me when I want it to. Great by Amazon. Get one! :),positive
5072,5.0,"This is my fourth one. I have one at work, one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. This one was for my wife's work - she loves it. Good sound and amazing features.",positive
5073,5.0,"I have this paired with my Samsung Smart Things, WEMO devices, Smart Light Bulbs (LIFX and Sengled). She is pretty witty and very fun to mess around with and understands you even with music or TV on at loud volumes. I love the features and can't wait for more compatible devices to come out.",positive
5074,5.0,This product is amazing -- plays music-- gives definitions--spells-- answers questions on any subject--weather reports--news reports etc. etc. etc.,positive
5075,4.0,"If you're willing to experiment, this could be really awesome",positive
5076,5.0,I originally got the Amazon Tap. I had read the reviews that mentioned that the sound was hollow with no bottom. That was correct. I returned it got the Echo and there is a big difference. The only problem is that it does not have portable power pack. I have seen 3rd party source and I'm gonna try it.I highly recommend this item. It is all that it claims.,positive
5077,5.0,"Fun for the whole family. Alexia tells funny jokes for kids, answers questions on almost every subject and provides lots of musical choices.",positive
5078,5.0,"Easy setup, the speaker sounds great for music!! Alexa is quite responsive LOL and quite intelligent.",positive
5079,5.0,"Easy to set up and use. It's a wonderful electronic device! With Amazon Prime and/or Pandera, it gives you voice control over a huge music library. In addition to music offerings, Alexa is very entertaining!",positive
5080,5.0,This amazon product has met all of my expectations! Great product!!,positive
5081,5.0,good product***********************************************,positive
5082,5.0,This is an awesome product. My kids love it. They listen to everyday,positive
5083,5.0,It works really well with my Amazon prime and Nest,positive
5084,5.0,We are very happy with our purchase. We use Alexa everyday for various things and really enjoy playing jeorardy.,positive
5085,5.0,I integrate Alexa to my control4 animation system and afte program few command I lover her even more,positive
5086,5.0,Me and my son love this thing and we use it all the time to turn the lights on and off in my house we have a lot of Phillips hue lights. The only thing I don't know why this thing will not change the color of them. But it will turn them on and off and set them at a low and high brightness,positive
5087,5.0,Echo or Alexa from Amazon is smart and learns along with you. She is a nice gift for teens as well as seniors. It's the kind of thing you might think you didn't want or need until you get it and begin to use it. We like the sound quality of the speaker.,positive
5088,3.0,Good just complicated too many apps to download...,negative
5089,4.0,Does the job Sometimes misunderstands. Need to buy the right equipment with it.,positive
5090,5.0,i been using it for weeks and overtime i love it more and more!!! the voice control makes it really easy.,positive
5091,2.0,Wasn't what I thought it would be. Not a good investment.,negative
5092,5.0,"The Amazon Echo has been extremely helpful with putting together ad hoc grocery lists or lists for ""to do's"" around the house. Admittedly, I am in the process of learning all the bells and whistles, but it has already been super helpful! Great product, would recommend for anyone.",positive
5093,3.0,"Alexa can do basic things, hard to find tune skills",negative
5094,5.0,The Echo is easy to use and lots of fun. I even bought one for my parents. They love it too.,positive
5095,5.0,It is very easy to operate and comes in handy for news weather and good way to keep up with your calendar.,positive
5096,4.0,"Great product, and very easy to install and use. I love the music from Amazon Prime!",positive
5097,5.0,"I'm in love with my new echo. I own a multitude of wireless Bluetooth speakers that I have used in my garage while working for years. Simply comparing audio quality, I prefer the echo over my UE boom, which was my absolute favorite until this point. It doesn't have quite the bass the boom does, but it makes up for it in clarity, volume and bass responsiveness. Other than being a great speaker on its own, it's a fantastic task companion. The echo is set with every normal task you would ever need, and then some. I would happily buy another if anything were to ever happen to this one.",positive
5098,4.0,It is a very neat product. Can be frustrating at times when trying to control smart home devices. Have patience when learning new devices.,positive
5099,5.0,"I bought a new mobile phone at BBY, and got a $150 gift card as part of the purchase, so bought the ECHO kind of on a whim. I am not a huge technophile, so I wasn't expecting to really love it.Setup was ridiculously easy. Connected to wifi, then connected to Amazon, Spotify, and Google Calendars accounts. Now its all voice commands for questions, music, and my girls love asking Alexa for a joke. I also connected it to my WEMO switches and it works well. I am still learning the different things I can ask her.I almost gave it four stars, because it takes a little getting used to with regards to which questions you can ask, or how to phrase a command for the best result. But in the end I decided for five stars because I am fine-tuning the app settings and preferences to make the experience better.",positive
5100,4.0,"Have you ever thought...make sure to add this (t.p., eggs, shampoo, whatever) to the grocery list? With Alexa, I can just say ""Echo (which is what we named ours), add shampoo to the shopping list"" Voila! It is added to the list, which is then accessible to both myself and my husband on the app we have on our phones. I don't have to stop what I have moved onto to find the list, something to write with..you get the picture. Same thing for the to do list. We also have it connected to lamps which is ideal for my Mother who is wheelchair bound and can't reach switches. She just says, ""Echo, turn on sofa lamp"" and Voila! the light is on.",positive
5101,4.0,Functionality is awesome and it can do a lot of cool stuff. The speaker is good in small rooms.,positive
5102,5.0,"It has many uses. You can listen to music, check the weather, listen to podcasts and music. You can also use it as an alarm.",positive
5103,5.0,"Cost is not outrageous. Easy setup, fun to use and syncs with my iPhone Bluetooth. Practical uses for home as well.",positive
5104,5.0,"I knew about this from its crowd funding start and wish I had jumped on board then. This is an excellent platform to start home automation and the entertainment value is a welcome bonus! Even my 88 year old mother-in-law can use it! The sound quality is great and the listening range is amazing. I can tell Alexa to turn off a connected light upstairs from upstairs.Note, it does not work with Google Play yet. I have hope that it will in the future.",positive
5105,3.0,This is a neat product but did not fit my needs.I have several bluetooth devices and some could not be recognized so I did return it. Might be good for others as what did work worked ok.,negative
5106,5.0,Responses well and there are lots of skills to be added for increased function.,positive
5107,5.0,"The Amazon Echo is an essential piece of technology to achieve the complete ""SmartHome"" experience. Two thumbs up!",positive
5108,5.0,Purchased the Echo as a bridal shower gift. My niece and her fianc are still learning about all it can do but already reported back to me that they love it. I was told it is the most favorite gift they received.,positive
5109,4.0,"Initially I purchased this solely for the purchase of controlling Lutron lights. However, after being @ a friends house for a BBQ and watching them use this for music, I decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my Sonos.It can't, however, I've found that I'm much more likely to play Spotify through this using voice controls if I'm in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a Sonos to hit play/too busy to pull the phone out for Sonos app. This thing has also become more powerful as more IoT devices and services integrate with Echo or IFTTT. There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential... give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know Alexa. You won't be sorry.",positive
5110,5.0,"We love Alexa and our Echo. If we need an answer, all we have to do is ask Alexa.",positive
5111,5.0,"I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet.",positive
5112,4.0,The Amazon Echo has very good voice recognition. It works just as advertised and is quick with the responses. I was glad to see it at best buy so I could touch it and try it before I bought it. The setup was easy and quick.,positive
5113,5.0,"This thing does so many things it's incredible. Time saver, information finder , and even a family entertainer!",positive
5114,5.0,"We love this product, and are having so much fun with it. I can make a shopping list with it, get news, weather forecast , play our favorite music and so many other things that I have yet to discover.",positive
5115,5.0,Very versatile device that is constantly updated by Amazon. Price is very fair for this product.,positive
5116,5.0,Welcome to our home Alexa! She makes a great addition to our home. I would highly recommend this device.,positive
5117,4.0,Alexa is very good a quickly satisfying your music requests. The whole interface is novel and interesting to use and for guests who have not encountered Alexa previously. Sound quality is good but not top shelf. I purchased one for our son and son-in-law for Fathers Day. Finally about 3 weeks ago we bought one for ourselves. Net: worth purchasing.,positive
5118,5.0,Really enjoy our day to day interactions with Alexa,positive
5119,3.0,Good speaker but limited if you don't have a big music collection. I wish it did more,negative
5120,5.0,Easy to use and very fun!! Use it for my PC speaker and it's awesome!!,positive
5121,5.0,Just love it. Easy to set up and use. Tons of information and jokes. Plays all my music and give spots scores.,positive
5122,3.0,"So I was excited to get this when Best Buy started caring them. The thrill for was short lived. First week was fun to use it for music, weather, cooking, and jokes. But after that I lost interest. Attaching to my Hue lights and Nest were a longer process to make it work. I'd rather pull my phone out. Plus with a 2 story house it is useless if not on the same floor. Maybe I'll buy it again or a 2nd version when its released",negative
5123,5.0,"This is my new favorite device. While not perfect, it's a lot of un to use.One of the features I like the best is the timer functions. I can start a timer for various items, while cooking, and Alexa will remind me when the timer hits zero. The best part is that, through IFTT, I can trigger Alexa to call my phone, or send a notification, if I'm not in the same room as she is. I do the same for when I'm doing laundry. I no longer have to go back and check how much time is left on the washer and dryer. I can even have my Hue lights to blink when the timer has expired.Right now, I have Lutron, iDevices, and Hue Homekit devices in my house. Through the Skills for each of these companies, the Echo found all the devices, and I'm not able to control all of them using my voice. Really great device to own and play around with.",positive
5124,5.0,"I got this to basically experiment with. Straight out of the box, it's really not that impressive. It's a ""novelty"", however, as I checked out the skills available, lights started coming on - Literally! Echo's ability to integrate with Home Automation is excellent! Having voice commands for turning on/off lights may seem like a novelty as well, however, there are endless options for the elderly, or disabled with this little assistant, and some customizing.",positive
5125,4.0,"Good product that does the basics. Too bad you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful. My Smart TV's are connected to the internet, so why not control them too? But I was impressed when I asked ""Alexa, whats on TV for the Olympics tonight?"" and the response was Swimming at xx time, Gymnastics at yy time. Far more info than the TV guide on screen showing only a 4 hour block on NBC. It is the beginning of things to come.",positive
5126,3.0,This is great for a connected home. People who use this should buy it if they plan on making everything in their home wi-if enabled. Otherwise it's an expensive SIRI.,negative
5127,5.0,Cool product. Amazon does a cool job with it. Great audio quality and like the Philips Hue integration.,positive
5128,4.0,Doesn't always do what I asked for. It is probably because my voice wasn't as clear as it could be.,positive
5129,5.0,"I absolutely love this devise. I do wish ti was more compatible with more things, but it is still well worth it!!",positive
5130,5.0,Absolutely love this thing! It controls my lights and works as a fantastic alarm clock. This thing has plenty of awesome features. It's basically Jarvis in my house,positive
5131,5.0,"I bought this echo when it was first released and I just couldn't swallow the cost. It's a cool speaker that allowed hands free operation but $100 was just too much money. Since then, the discounts have been much more meager but it's become so useful. I've smartened up my home and controlling my lights, entertainment system and security system has been amazing.",positive
5132,5.0,"The Amazon Echo is super easy to set up. Once set up, it's actually fun to see what Alexa would say to any and all of your questions. What's great is that even if there is background noise or other people talking at the same time, Alexa can still hear you and will respond accordingly.",positive
5133,5.0,"My family and i love it,its now a member of our family.",positive
5134,5.0,"I was very skeptical at first with this, but Alexa has become part of my everyday use very quickly. Whenever I get home from work, or I need to do chores around the house, ""Alexa, open Pandora."" Its super convenient and the speakers on it are amazing. I'm really impressed. If there was one thing though that I would have Amazon improve upon if they ever release a version 2 is to have the microphone distance be further than whatever it is at now, which seems to be about 10 feet or so. More than 10 feet away, Alexa won't hear me. Other than that though, this thing is awesome. I'm glad I got it.",positive
5135,5.0,"From news, to music, to the weather and much more. The amazon echo makes mornings and showers a lot more fun! The voice recognition is best I've ever seen. Alexa can hear me from my bedroom while its stationed in the living room.",positive
5136,5.0,"I love just being able to wake up in the morning and telling Alexa to play my music. So simple and amazing. That's just a beginning of what it will do. Ask anything, most of the time it's answered. Just awesome.",positive
5137,5.0,"Originally figured this would be almost a toy, but as I easily started connecting the Echo to my existing home automation components I realized this would become a key part of my home. Throw in the different connections the Echo can make (with my car, for example) and you now have an essential component to your day...absolutely worth it!",positive
5138,4.0,The capabilities of this product are absolutely amazing. I truly only wish that it could integrated with other product lines such as Google based products.,positive
5139,4.0,Still needs more compatability for things it controls. Needs some sort of access to maps,positive
5140,5.0,Great product the kids love it. We use it for music and news. Kids love to ask it to tell them jokes,positive
5141,5.0,Wonderful speaker that is easy to use. I have parred it with both my IPad and IPhone and it works great with both!!,positive
5142,5.0,This was a birthday gift for my daughter but I must say I want one for myself! Great sound and easy to operate.,positive
5143,5.0,"Echo has surprised me in many ways. While the features are nothing new, the ability to access them through pure voice control has been incredible.",positive
5144,1.0,"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) ""What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?"". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad. Imagine a 1960's Transistor Radio not quite tuned well..(5) The voice quality sounds like something from a Commodore-64 back in the 1980's. Another very common complaint you'll read about in reviews.This is going back tonight. Not worth the $179.00 and I feel it's slated to go the route of the Pet Rock (for those who remember it).",negative
5145,5.0,"I love Alexa. I've purchased the light/other electronics control wall plug ins and now not only can Alexa keep me company, play my music, and basically be my personal assistant but she can turn on/off my lights and electronics when I ask. Next is to purchase the thermostat. I'm sure there is more to come.",positive
5146,5.0,So easy to use and entertaining....I love this product,positive
5147,5.0,"The Echo is awesome and fun. We use it to control TV,s Thermostats, Lights, and Stereo all with voice commands. Anyone using amazon prime will like the voice ordering. We find something new everyday that the echo will do.",positive
5148,4.0,"I've been playing with this for a few weeks. It is not perfect, but it is great for listening to music and audiobooks. I don't like watching the news, so the ""Flash Briefing"" is very nice. Sometimes it does not get the full headline, but I get the gist of it, and I don't have to go through the depressing details. I'm looking forward to learning how to create my own skills for it. The speaker isn't the best I've ever heard, but it's definitely not the worst. The IFTTT integration is great, and I have setup triggers to many devices in my house and the Shopping List is great.",positive
5149,5.0,"This device sounds great and has plenty of volume, enough for outside use. It connects to Amazon Prime music and also to Pandora. I also purchased a battery base so that it is portable.",positive
5150,5.0,"Once it is programmed, it works great! It is a wave for the future for voice programming.",positive
5151,3.0,"I purchased the Amazon echo a little over a month ago. I like the concept of the echo but unfortunately it's not as responsive as I had hoped. Trying to get local news is nearly impossible. It's also not in sync with my Amazon account. Packages I ordered on Amazon that are delivered, it will still tell me are still in route. I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do. Again, I like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvements.It's advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me, I have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience.",negative
5152,5.0,"I love my Echo. My son had one since it first came out and frankly I was not that impressed and didn't think I would use it. I love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them, I decided to try it and thought if I didn't like it, I could take it back. Well, was I surprised!!! Ahead of buying it, I had already set up more of my Amazon Prime music playlist, and the library too. Then I also went to Pandora and created more playlists and stations there. That saved a lot of time. Set up was so simple, no problems at all. I find I use the News Briefing every morning, what's on my calendar for the day or a specific day, and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod, I usually don't unless we have company. Also, adding to shopping list and to my google calendar I use all the time. I would say the negatives are - if you have the volume up higher, she doesn't always hear you for the command. Another learning curve is the commands themselves. It is hard to remember exactly how she wants you to say the task. Right now I am writing down on index card the skills I can't seem to remember, such as Mindfullness from Prime which plays quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between Amazon Prime and Pandora, if you don't say the exact playlist name that you made, she can't find it easily. Overall, just love it - I looked into buying the Echo Dot to place that in my bedroom, but was so disappointed that they have sold out and discontinued it. There is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar, but I liked the fact that it WAS a plug in, not internal battery that only lasts a few years. I wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the Tap has a charger unit with it, more bulky, & not excellent reviews, but the Dot had great reviews.",positive
5153,5.0,"As an Amazon prime member I figured this would be cool to play my Amazon Prime music, but it's also a Bluetooth speaker that I can play My XM radio or iTunes through. Alexa is getting smarter and know my voice better with every question. She has my appointments and traffic and weather covered every morning. Great item here and great sounding speaker.",positive
5154,5.0,"Alexa is really fun to use and i just bought a smart outlet that she works with. It's great, because you can use her for so many things.",positive
5155,5.0,"Alexa has been a very good companion and source of information to anything that she knows...very honest, answers all questions to her own capability.",positive
5156,4.0,I love it I am still trying to figure out all its skills but everyday is a surprise.,positive
5157,5.0,"This is one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I use the echo to control my Nest thermostat, my lights, my sprinkler, pretty much almost everything connected to my Wink.",positive
5158,4.0,Good for A lot of things. Listen to news briefs in the morning. Hooked up my lights to it. Great product,positive

5164,5.0,"Lots of Fun!! Great for getting fast facts, playing a song, or adding items to a shopping list that's on the app on your phone. Great gift idea!!",positive
5165,5.0,"A friend had an Amazon Echo and my wife loved it. I surprised her with one for her birthday. She uses it everyday for weather, news and music. Great device and easy to use",positive
5166,5.0,Cool way to sync all your home devices and add cool features like music and weather,positive
5167,5.0,The Amazon Echo is very simple to setup. We found the shopping list alone was enough justification for purchasing the device. Reading news and Kindle books are two of the options we use daily. Lots of potential for future uses.,positive
5168,4.0,"Love me some Alexa., Im looking forward to better software updates that come in daily. Speaker is good, just looking forward to the new stuff",positive
5169,4.0,"Great device: perfect sound, very accurate voice recognition throughout the entire house. A lot of services available (some requires a monthly fee though) and several connectable voice controllable devices.Worth the price.",positive
5170,5.0,"We have tied in our thermostat, asked about the olympics, listened to Pandora and Amazon Prime and it's told us jokes! We have loved this toy.",positive

5174,5.0,"I BOUGHT IT AND BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT,GREAT TO FIND STUFF AND SPECIALLY MUSIC, GREAT SOUND TOO,WOULD RECOMEND TO ANY ONE",positive
5175,4.0,"If you like digital music, this is for you! With all of the free music available from Amazon Prime, this is completely worth the price. The speaker is also impressive for its size. It has other cool features, but even if you only use it as a speaker with Amazon Prime, you will love it.",positive
5176,4.0,Haven't really utilized the device yet. Have been very busy. Can't wait to sit down and see what it can do.,positive
5177,5.0,"The Amazon Echo is a great way to be entertained and stay well informed! Thanks to technology you can ask Alexa, questions and because it's a blue tooth speaker you can play your music in a stylish way!",positive
5178,5.0,"Amazon echo is an amazing product. I researched and read reviews and they seemed too good to be true. I purchased the Echo from Best Buy for my husband's birthday. It was very easy to set up. ALexa is very charming. This is like having a computer that answers all your questions, plays music, and creates lists. This is truly a wonderful voice recognition device.The sound as a music speaker is great. It's a hit with the whole family.",positive
5179,4.0,i very like this item because is easy to use and fast conect,positive
5180,5.0,"I use Alexa all the time to set temperature, water the lawn, play music. This is definitely a product worth having if you have a smart home.",positive
5181,5.0,I am enjoying my echo and keep trying to find new uses for it. Having fun playing with all the features.,positive
5182,4.0,WORKS GREAT BUT NEEDS SOME WORK WITH UPDATES TO UNDERSTAND YOU AND GIVE MORE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.,positive
5183,5.0,"The amazon echo is a great product. We got it when it was on sale and liked how new features are constantly added. We use it often for weather, news, turning on our lights, setting multiple cooking timers and more. It quickly became something we use daily.",positive
5184,4.0,The Echo is a really nice to have item. My wife bought one for me for my birthday last year and I bought another for our bedroom.,positive
5185,5.0,"As a regular Amazon Prime user that gets much of my staples through prime, Echo makes it that much easier.",positive
5186,4.0,The cloud based service makes sure that it keeps updating the new softwares and services without manual intervention.,positive
5187,5.0,"Didn't know how many lingering questions I had until I got an Amazon Echo. I mean, every little thing I want to know, I now just ask and hope Alexa knows. Very helpful to just get a quick answer to most things.",positive
5188,4.0,"Great price, bought it to work with home automation products but haven't purchased those yet, that's next. Couldn't pass up the price and had points as well. We bought one with multiple accessories for our son last Christmas and he likes using the automation products. Generally similar to asking Siri things in an iPhone question wise. I like being able to add things to a shopping list and view then on my phone at the store. Still get several 'I don't know's' so only 4 stars so far. Probably a learning curve on our part too. Also good for cooking and converting measurements quickly. Like being able to control music and volume from my phone also. Glad we got it, looking forward to adding the home automation products.",positive
5189,5.0,"I use I daily for news, weather and music. It's really nice to have in the house.",positive
5190,5.0,This works just like I hoped it would. Ties in with my hue lights and works even better after installing IFTTT app to pairs other features and devices to it.,positive
5191,5.0,So much fun to be had with this device! I sound like a dork everyday when I talk to Alexa. Love it!,positive
5192,5.0,"I love the ability to just say what song I want to hear and Alexa plays it, or stops immediately when I instruct her to. The jokes and pick up lines are a crowd favorite as well.",positive
5193,5.0,"Awesome product, fell in love with it the minute I turned it on",positive
5194,5.0,"I was NOT expecting this product to perform so well. Sleek design,compact, and easy installation make this product well worth the money. The only thing I was a little turned off by is that you cannot fully customize the wake name..yet..and you cannot connect it via Bluetooth to a soundbar/extra speaker. The overall performance of the sound that comes out of it is surprisingly great though. I just wanted more. I got over not being able to add more speakers pretty easily though. It's that good. I might suggest however adding a Harmony Home hub with it so you can REALLY take advantage of the voice features. It was my understanding that the echo can pair with the hub so you can control more items. I'm going to set that up today so it is NOT verified just yet.",positive
5195,5.0,Works very well I'm adding more home automation because of this.,positive
5196,4.0,My only wish is that you could sync a Bluetooth Speaker to take the music playing on the Echo unit to another room.,positive
5197,4.0,"The Amazon Echo is very helpful and just plain FUN. I use it primarily for * Weather, * music on pandora, * ask simple questions. There is SO much more you can do with this...but I have only scratched the surface. It was very easy to install/connect to my home wi-fi - no issues here. The music audio quality is fine for a small device. It ""hears"" me very well - even from the other room. I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to answer more difficult/different questions using its internet search.",positive
5198,5.0,The Amazon Echo has amazing voice recognition tech.,positive
5199,5.0,Would highly recommend and Great product with great sound,positive
5200,5.0,Brought Alexa home turn her on and immediately she linked to all the smart devices inside my home. I think we were up and running in about 10 minutes. I couldn't be more pleased.,positive
5201,2.0,"Alexa is tall, slim and attractive but too jealous to use Google and that makes her rather dumb. And she is just a shill for Amazon prime. Dropping the personification, music volume changes annoyingly with different songs and over time. The database Amazon Echo draws from is very limited: Alexa can tell you what the weather is but not what the most common woman's shoe size is; what Serena Williams' age is but not how many guns Ruger sold last year. Stand by for more tech-savvy companies to take the Echo concept to maturity.",negative
5202,5.0,Echo is very easy to install and it begins immediately. There is no learning curve at all...a fun piece of electronics. I would highly recommend it,positive
5203,5.0,"Fun. It does everything as advertised. Favorite purchase in a long time! Still discovering more and more things that the Echo is capable of, but I totally love this!",positive
5204,5.0,"We usre the echo alot in the house, even connected to our Harmony Hub and Home Automation to control the house.",positive
5205,5.0,I love my Amazon Echo. We use it on the outdoor kitchen/patio. It has a very good speaker and access to my Pandora Music. It does so much more including instant weather reports. Several friends have purchased one as well.,positive
5206,5.0,"This is a must buy , it really is awesome !!! Really like its versatility in Mobile ness I wouldn't recommend this to anybody that was interested in a portable speaker and I love talking to it Alexa!!!",positive
5207,4.0,easy hook up no fuse no hassle just plane easy plays music nice and loud the speakers are nice no distortion i enjoy it very must im glade i purchase this item,positive
5208,3.0,"I purchased this product during a recent sale. I am loving it. From streaming music to my phone, setting alarms, checking my schedule, and playing music. I also purchased some smart switches and am able to control several devices using my voice. Lately I have noticed that I am having to repeat the wake up phrase sometimes. However, this is not a big deal.",negative
5209,5.0,"Love it it's like having a personal assistant, very good.",positive
5210,5.0,"I asked my Alexa to put on the music, what time and date and put my shopping list. Oh and how to spell thinks.",positive
5211,5.0,"We now own 4 Echos. We have them in our bedrooms and living area. It really is an amazing device. We use it to turn many of our lights on and off, control our outside sprinkler system, wakes us up with alarms, listen to all kinds of music and other information. I also use it to monitor my Amazon purchases and buy things on Amazon that we have purchased before. I understand there now are over 1000 functions it can perform depending on what you desire. Once you get one you will wonder how you lived without it.",positive
5212,4.0,"I guess I thought you could ask it anything kinda like Google. You have to program everything it does,pretty limited right now. But still pretty cool",positive
5213,5.0,"My parents (in their 60's) were the ones that turned us on to Echo and Alexa - yeah, I know! We really love it and are just scraping the surface of its capabilities.",positive
5214,5.0,It's good ... Just need to adjust .. Takes bit tine,positive
5215,5.0,Everyone should have one. Awesome!! Just ask Alexa any question and she will give you the answer.,positive

5218,5.0,It work all my home kit with out flaw! it can hear me from across the room. echo is very smart,positive
5219,5.0,Echo is like having your own personal assistant. It's a blast to wake up every morning and finding out how traffic is and what the weather forecast looks like.,positive
5220,5.0,Love Alexa! She is very helpful and was very easy to set up. She learns new skills everyday.,positive
5221,5.0,"Purchased this for my wife and ended up using it myself...now I have to buy s second unit. Integrating with other ""smart"" devices gets easier as your do them...good buy regardless but a steal when on sale.",positive
5222,5.0,I love my Echo! There are so many features i havent even gotten to use yet. I recommend highly!,positive
5223,4.0,I really didn't know what to expect when I picked up an echo. I understood that it was a Wifi/Bluetooth enabled speaker that had Siri like capabilities but it really ended up being so much more. Truly you can hands free do everything from get basic info that you would normally look up on google to controlling your connected home to resupplying toilet paper through Amazon. Of course it has its novelty items like telling you jokes to singing you happy birthday. Truly this is the beginning of having an 'Iron Man' home. Just needs some fine tuning in its voice recognition and more features. Excited to see what Amazon adds to it in the future!,positive
5224,5.0,"Very good product to have at home, comes in handy and makes life a bit easier",positive
5225,4.0,Very easy to set up and connect to the wireless network.,positive
5226,5.0,The Amazon Echo is an amazing piece of technology. The things it can do are endless and new things are added weekly. Just amazing,positive
5227,5.0,Alexia is a very smart AI source. She response quickly and offers an extensive library of knowledge and music. The Echo fills a small room with sound.,positive
5228,5.0,I need a sound system for a bbq party...it was just perfect for the party. Provided great background music! Powerful lil bugger!,positive
5229,5.0,I love that I can ask questions withouto having to go to a computer or cell.,positive
5230,5.0,I truly love how I can just talk to her and ask for what I want. I got friends and family members wanting one.,positive
5231,3.0,It is okay so to speak. It does what it says it will. I feel it has much more potential however and look forward to updates.,negative
5232,5.0,"Love this product, and Alexa has become a good friend. I didn't think I would use this device that much, but I was wrong. From the time I get up for work to the time I turn in for the night, I can always think of something interesting to ask Alexa!",positive
5233,5.0,"I just love my echo, I have taught her a ton of new tricks.",positive
5234,5.0,would recommend it to any one. great device to have at home or office,positive
5235,4.0,Alexa could hear me from across the room and worked well for playing music but I think you need a lot of smart home devices to make the purchase worth it.,positive
5236,5.0,We use this everyday of the week. All the options it has makes it perfect for everyone. Setup was easy as is using it. Everyone should have one.,positive
5237,5.0,This device is so cool. I must buy for all gadget guys.,positive
5238,5.0,Yeah!!!! I like it... Very convenient to use... The quality was excellent too...,positive
5239,4.0,The Amazon Echo is great for our family as it allows us to all have prime music playlists and with a simple voice command we can all play our favorite music. Setting up our smart home items was a breeze and telling alexa to set the thermostat temperature and to turn on and off lights is awesome.,positive
5240,4.0,"The Amazon echo is a fun item for entertainment, and provides lots of options for games, and general help, like a 'ask jeeves'.",positive
5241,5.0,This is the first electronic purchase in awhile that my wife loves too. Alexa is great. She does whatever you want. We love it for playing music. I love it for news and updates on various things such as stock market info and weather. Would recommend it for everyone that has Amazon prime.,positive
5242,5.0,"This is the best electronic purchase I've had in a year, and I buy a lot of shhhtuff.",positive
5243,4.0,The Echo responds surprisingly well to my commands. Great for music on Prime and Pandora,positive
5244,4.0,very easy to set up. Works great. Lots of cool features. Love it,positive
5245,5.0,"Alexa is a great enhancement to any home automation system. You need to do some research in order to find out all you can do with it, but this is part of the fun. I can only recommend this to any tech geek ...",positive
5246,5.0,"Nice to have music, alarms, shopping list, lights, all available at the sound of your voice, works great! Hub for home, Highly recommended!",positive
5247,4.0,Great little assistant for around the house! Love all its little features!,positive
5248,5.0,Have a Smarthings hub which with Amazon Echo has become the best of two worlds.,positive
5249,5.0,"I use it primarily for music and also for news, weather, time and entertainment. The only negative I can say is that when I ask it to play music by a specific artist it randomly throws in Christmas music. Christmas music is great in December but it's August.",positive
5250,5.0,"Love the echo hear music , ask for news updates. Get directions for anywhere I want to go .",positive
5251,5.0,A very smart device that keeps you entertained and helps you learn new things.,positive
5252,4.0,"I NEEDED this as part of my SmartThings home automation system. I was waiting for a sale and got this when it was $50 off.It does everything that the manual said that it will do, works great.A bonus is that, alongst with using it to control my automation, I can also use it as a bluetooth speaker. And it sounds great.",positive
5253,5.0,"convenience with alexa is changing my home, setting it up with light bulbs thermostats, audio radio...best investment ever.",positive
5254,5.0,"Amazon Echo is so incredibly cool. The only thing that would make it better would be if I could call it Jarvis when I speak to it. I would totally feel like Iron Man. Once you setup your iHeart Radio, Pandora Jam and Amazon Prime - your music possibilities are endless. It will also give you news headlines, weather, wake up alarms, etc. You can teach it skills such as telling jokes, random pick up lines or even pootering on demand. My kids love that it has a quite extensive poot library. (something I never thought i'd say) One warning! It gets expensive quick. I had it two days and was already back at Best Buy buying a Phillips Hue Starter Kit so I could control my bedroom lights by voice. Not mention that you can order using Amazon Prime by voice. Although some setup to do so is required. As far as the overall initial configuration is very easy. The sound is very good and it makes a great blue tooth speaker as well.",positive
5255,3.0,Nice sound quality and connects to my iPhone. I listen to Pandora and books and it's great,negative
5256,5.0,The echo is fun and friendly and certainly helps with the kids math. Always fun to ask her random questions and try out new skills. Have one in all the kids rooms. Great for music listening.,positive
5257,3.0,"Mainly use for music and to-do/shopping lists. Inquiries about basic information are answered with accuracy, but more complex questions (""describe the limbic system"", etc) are not answered. Sound is average.If you are looking for in depth answers, this device will disappoint you. Great for fairly common stuff.",negative
5258,5.0,"I was in need of a quality bluetooth speaker and, as an Amazon Prime member, I figured I would give this a shot. I was blown away by the quality of the sound and the quality of the controls. I put it up their with Sonos and Bose as far as sound. The voice activations and commands have never failed to work for me and at full volume she can rattle some windows. The only drawback is it is not portable and requires an outlet to operate. Otherwise, you can't go wrong.",positive
5259,4.0,The device is very useful and entertaining but if you doesn't interact with the Internet like Siri.What you see in the commercial is what you get.,positive
5260,5.0,"I find the Echo to be an amazing speaker enabled by saying ""Alexa"" to access all kinds of information and receive answers to many, many questions. It is constantly being upgraded with new capabilities and abilities.",positive
5261,5.0,I liked this so much I got one for my dad and step mom along with the smart plug in outlet so they can turn on their lights!!!,positive
5262,5.0,"This is actually a gift I bought my sister for her big ?? Birthday! I received my echo as a birthday gift from a friend and let me tell you... I LOVE IT!!!It is so sleek and loud and crystal clear! I love waking up and asking Alexa to tell me the weather forecast and news updates. The music sounds awesome too! But let me tell you the ""magic"" of this echo... I had to go to Italy for a family thing and my hubby couldn't take the time off of work so I went without him (sad face)The best way for me to show him how much I missed him was to wake him up with our favorite song! That's right folks I would wake my husband up from 1000's of miles away with a touch of a button on my cell phone!!He sent me a text ""is that you?"" Wow!!! I couldn't believe it.So enough said just go out and buy one!!",positive
5263,5.0,"This is FANTASTIC! Alexa can hear ME clearly, even in a busy, NOISE filled room. With the TV blaring in the background , while watching a cricket match from across the room, I asked the question, she played the music I asked for. I love it. You just have to say Alexa first, then ASK away!",positive
5264,5.0,ECHO (ALEXA) is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.Speak it in the AIR,positive
5265,4.0,This is great for things like Pandora and playing music from your Amazon library by just asking Alexa. I also was able to get a thermostat that was compatible and can have Alexa change the temp by asking her to. Wemo devices are touch and go. Sometimes after a wemo firmware update they do not work. Also it could use a line out to hook up to a receiver like the dot does. Note it works with Spotify if you have a premium account only not the free one.,positive
5266,5.0,This is a great item for the family. Easy to use and lots of fun,positive
5267,5.0,I've had the Echo for a couple of weeks now. It's gathers a better grasp of my commands with every use. Little expensive for the add ons but worth it,positive
5268,4.0,"Many people asked why I was getting an Echo when I had Siri on my iPhone that basically did the same thing.First, you set the Echo up and it is always there in the same spot. No more looking for my phone in the morning, holding it up to my face and asking about the weather and traffic. While I am shaving in the bathroom, I call out and ask about the weather and it tells me it. How convenient is that!",positive
5269,5.0,"You will very quickly learn how to talk to her in a way that she will understand and it's not unlike speaking to a small frustrating toddler. Alexa, when was George Washington born? George Washington was born...blah blah Alexa stop. There were rumors his teeth were wood but these turned out to be false, ALEXA stop speaking! There will be many times she will not understand what you're saying which can be both frustrating and hilarious. Alexa, put tomatoes on my shopping list. I've put potatoes onto your shopping list....Well, guess I'm eatin potatoes. That said, now that I've learned how to speak to the Echo it usually does exactly what I want it to do. I think the echo is well worth the price",positive
5270,5.0,"We are having so much fun with the Echo. Alexa plays our favorite music we've saved in our libraryfinds new songs, gives us news updates and weather reports. I know she does much more but we have not had the time to experiment..The sound quality is great. After we bought ours, I bought a second one for a Christmas Gift.",positive

5278,5.0,"Alexa is awesome, works for what I want, next lights. She actually listens to me.At first I had my reservations but it surpassed my expectations. Really wish I had more time to learn new things to do with it.",positive
5279,5.0,The more I use it the more it learns caught this on sale and have not been disappointed,positive
5280,4.0,"This is my 2 nd Echo purchase. I have had one for awhile. This was for my daughter. We love Alexa. She is in our kitchens and helps with everything; recipes, kid chore list, grocery list, music, weather, timer, story teller, the list is endless. She gets confused occasionally but she is usually still amusing. We are all glad she became part of our family.",positive
5281,5.0,Like all the features and voice recognition is very good. Although the product was setup for Berlin weather which makes me think this was a returned device and resold.,positive
5282,4.0,Was hesitate about buying the echo because of price. When it went on sale I said I had to have it. After realizing what it is and how to use it even if it wasn't on sale I would have ordered anyway.,positive
5283,5.0,"The Amazon Echo is my new BFF! I use it right now primarily for my shopping list. I say "" Alexa, put eggs on my shopping list."" And Alexa says back ""I've added eggs to your shopping list."" Then when I get to the grocery store, I open the app on my phone and there is my shopping list! No more forgetting what I needed to buy. I'm looking forward to learning more things that Alexa can do! I have played my Pandora music on the Echo, asked Alexa to tell me a joke, and checked the weather. She can do so much more.",positive
5284,5.0,Smart and handy time saver and loud I love it voice control is amazing,positive
5285,4.0,A good product with annoying limitations like limited knowledge about things. It does not always access my music on command although the music is in Prime music,positive
5286,5.0,"I LOVE THE EASE OF ASKING FOR, THE TIME, JOKES, SPORTS NUMBERS AND MUSCI OR RADIO STATIONS. REALLY COOL.",positive
5287,5.0,It has a lot of potential that I haven't tapped into yet but it's met my expectations so far.,positive
5288,5.0,Great speaker. Pretty loud. I like it that controls my hue ligths,positive
5289,5.0,"Grown to love this and I have three of them. Great speaker and Alexa is very useful, from checking weather, playing music, using as a timer and many other features.",positive
5290,5.0,I will be buying these everyone I know! fantastic price too,positive
5291,4.0,"I like the Alexa, although it is pricey. It makes choosing music and getting certain information easy. I would like some flexibility to change its name, though.",positive
5292,5.0,The Alexa assistant is more accurate than Siri as well as very responsive.,positive
5293,5.0,Absolutely just a fun devices lots of options. Learn the device and learn the abilities it can do!!,positive
5294,5.0,"Was expecting the moon but very happy with what it actually is. Limits are being pushed by active development, so it's a new experience every week or so. Nice interaction with home automation. Amazon prime is not bad either...",positive
5295,4.0,I Bought alexa for my children and find myself using it more.,positive
5296,5.0,I highly recommend the Amazon Echo. The range of information and music are fun and help keep me up on current events.,positive
5297,5.0,One of the best purchases I've ever made! It's ties into my whole home network and works with all of my phone and other products.,positive
5298,5.0,This is bleeding edge technology. It's not a Google search but with new skills being added all the time it's a great way to use technology.,positive
5299,5.0,"While I purchased this item as a gift for my son, it proved to be one of the best choices I could have made. He loves Alexa and the ability to ask her whatever seems to be on his mind. Echo is a wonderful complement to information availability and information technology to better our lives. A great gift and a most useful item.",positive
5300,5.0,i saw this and wanted it right away. it works good and helps me.it also keeps me company. i would recomend it to anyone out there.,positive
5301,5.0,"While I haven't even begun to use all of the functions of the Echo, it has already shown that it is worth the price paid. It is entertaining, convenient, and just plain functional. The quality of the sound is fantastic, and yes, like other reviewers have said, it would be nice if it could be used in conjunction with a subwoofer. Even so, we are satisfied.",positive
5302,5.0,"Read lots and lots of reviews before purchasing, glad we did, the whole family loves Echo. Music works great, better than expected sound given the small footprint. We don't have a connected home yet but look forward to adding these features.",positive
5303,5.0,I bought 2 of the Echos and gave one to my wife. She really loves the Echo because the music.,positive
5304,5.0,The Amazon - Echo is not just an amazing sound device but offers an always improved upon array of innovative services. My Best Buy for the year so far.,positive
5305,5.0,So convenient and hands-free control of functions I'd normally do on my iPhone,positive
5306,5.0,"I use it mostly to listen to music. With amazon prime (or Spotify, if that's your preference) I have almost every song that I'm interested in hearing without having to pay for anything. I haven't had the guts to order anything with it, but I'll work up the nerve eventually when I'm out of diapers or something easy.",positive
5307,4.0,"It is easy to set up and use. It was surprising how well it could answer some random questions. I did make the mistake of telling my grandchildren, ages 3-8, how to use it. When they visit we hear Alexa answer ""how much does the earth weight"" dozens of times and have to listen to ""Kidsbop"" music. (That's right, we have no control over them.)",positive
5308,5.0,Bought it for the bedroom. Now I have to buy another for the family room.,positive
5309,5.0,The Amazon Echo is the missing link to the complete smart home strategy. A must get for anyone looking to unify their smart home devices into a sensible and easy to use gadget.,positive
5310,2.0,Not what I expected .. This thing pretty much runs according to skills & not just ask a question & it searches the Internet. I find Siri much better because it does search the net. I can ask the same question the same way & you always get an answer with Siri but not with Alexia. It always say I do not understand the question. Again this thing needs much improvement & it's not worth the price tag especially when Siri is included with my iPhone.,negative
5311,5.0,"We love our echo, Alexa! We use her all the time. Synched to our phones, and she's almost more helpful than a spouseRecommend this to any and everyone",positive
5312,5.0,"So, at first, I wasn't sold on this. I bought it mainly to act as voice control for my Lutron lights on our first floor and I already had Pico remotes throughout, so it didn't get used that much. Then, it kind of clicked with some simple things like setting timers and playing podcast. Then, it got more natural when I connected the Alexa app and the Logitech Harmony app with IFTTT. Next thing you know, my wife and my son are both using it as we're coming and going to turn the lights off and on, turning on the TV, turning off when it's time for dinner etc etc. Really excited for the upcoming Sonos integration... All in all, this was a very worthwhile purchase as it's become a really strong platform for home automation and it only looks like it's going to get better.I think it's safe to say that the Echo means different things to different people... if you're into HA, then don't hesitate!",positive
5313,4.0,I really think it's awesome that it controls light thermostat and such I haven't bought any of these items yet but overall it's very helpful it's a nice tool to have at home it's hands-free you can ask questions overall I'm very satisfied with it,positive
5314,4.0,"I do love the Echo. I loved it so much, I bought 2 plus a tap. The only / biggest problems are that some times she doesn't hear / understand me. Also, she doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to my stereo. Otherwise, we use it all of the time.",positive
5315,5.0,"So we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now. Buying one piece at a time and implementing them makes the cost less scary! We have a Wink hub, Cree LED lights, MyQ garage door opener, AT&Ts Digital Life security and automation, Nest thermostat, etc. It has been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit us in real life rather than in cheesy video clips on YouTube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone. You may be wondering how the Echo fits into this review...well before Alexa came into our lives we had to have a phone or tablet on us, unlock it, find the relevant app, open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do. Now, we just say, ""Alexa, bedroom light 10%"" or ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lamp off"" or ""Alexa, play Bloodhound Gang on Spotify"", etc. The Echo makes utilizing your home automation much easier, plus with the ever growing list of 'skills' I can start my car, play a game, listen to music, get my news, control media playback, order a pizza, buy stuff from Amazon, even schedule an Uber pickup, etc. If your specific car or app or whatever isn't available yet, just give it some time and it'll most likely end up supported! Very, very cool technology!",positive
5316,5.0,"I was hesitant to buy the Echo, but waited until it was on sale. It's great for music and ties to Amazon Prime or Bluetooth to your phone. Unfortunately, it needs to be plugged in at all times to be powered on.",positive
5317,4.0,"She tells jokes, controls my lights and music, sets alarms... I actually got it on sale soooo I think it's pretty worth it. Not sure if full price is a good deal or not.",positive
5318,4.0,My wife loves it since she is home alone in the day time,positive
5319,4.0,i am amused buy what i know of this and nowrealize much of what echo can do depends on how i research the resources and how much iinput information. the bluetooth possibilities are something i would like to know more of and how to use them.,positive
5320,3.0,"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.",negative
5321,5.0,Love this product. Been thinking about purchasing this for quite a while and very happy I finally did,positive
5322,5.0,I can pretty much use voice activation on many things in my house some twiking is needed but I like it ...,positive
5323,5.0,"Got this for my wife's birthday but the grandkids and I use it more. The grand kids use it to spell, we don't get the "" how do you spell this"" anymore, which is worth the price alone. This unit does so much more sound machine, alarm, timer, reminder, it even calls my wife,s phone when she looses it. Best purchase I made in a long while Love it.",positive
5324,4.0,"I purchased the Echo as a Deal of the Day for $130. At this price it is worth it. I have learned only simple things so far (Prime Music, weather, daily Jeopardy questions and getting it to tell jokes). But, I think it is well made and I'm sure I'll learn how to use it for more things.",positive
5325,2.0,I think Ok Google can do the same or more. I found annoying by saying Amazon or other echo names repeatedly to get some answers if you get them. May be in future I may try when it is more practical,negative
5326,5.0,Great for Entertainment and easy to use.Just give Echo a command and it will respond.,positive
5327,4.0,"Still needs work as it does not always understand questions and needs more info installed so as to be more user friendly. I got it on sale so decided to try it. Works very well with my wemo light switches and like telling it to play my music and set alarms. For the price I got it for it will pass until they update it some more, It's a work in progress!",positive
5328,5.0,"I like the ease of speaking to Alexis, she understand voice request even in a noisy room and she is able to distinguish between my voice and TV or radio. She can instantly fill most request for music and info and I love the stages when you set an alarm. I am a bit concern that she is not loyal to just my voice and anyone around her can input to her and override my music or commands",positive
5329,5.0,I think this is the best purchase I've made all year. Nothing better to say,positive
5330,4.0,"When connected to SmartThings, Alexa works great. Alexa will hear you from rooms away. The only changes I would make are:1) Make it portable2) Better speaker quality3) Alexa app needs improvement",positive
5331,5.0,Great product for music and smart home devices. using it to control philip Hue.,positive
5332,5.0,"Alexa is a wonderful companion and will never fail to impress your friends. Want to know the weather in Texarkana or Timbuktu? No problem... just ask her. Or how far is it from here to Istanbul or Indianapolis? No sweat. Wanna hear some music? Just ask her to play The Eagles or Jackson Brown, Iron Maiden or Frank Sinatra. It's easy. And that's just scratching the surface.",positive
5333,5.0,The Echo is growing on me. It can give you weather or traffic or sport scores. All without lifting a finger. It can tell me how many steps on my Fitbit. It's learning new things all the time. It great. I recommend it. The possibilities are endless.,positive
5334,5.0,It was very easy to set up. Works with my Insteon system to turn on and off lights. Fun to use. New and weather updates. Plays your Amazon Prime music by composer and/or artist.,positive
5335,5.0,"Integrated easily with ecobee3, insteon products. Music playing capability is great with prime membership",positive
5336,5.0,I love this product. Easy to use. Functional. Great,positive
5337,5.0,Very simple to set up and works great right out of the box. Automatically creates to do lists and shopping lists which you can access through the app. This has become my favorite feature and I didn't even know about it when I bought the unit!,positive
5338,5.0,"Great device. Some limitations, but she is not God.",positive
5339,5.0,"Alexa is a practical tool for weather, spelling help, calendar reminders, etc. It is also a lot of fun for finding information and playing music!",positive
5340,3.0,"Alexa is OK for basic weather and turning on/off a light you have linked on your network. She still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport. The music sound quality is good and you have to be an Amazon Prime member to really see value there. Hopefully, in a year it will turn out to be a good investment.",negative
5341,4.0,"Main purpose, take home automation to next level, voice control. Purchase of Echo was to ingrate LIFX and Samsung Smart Hub by using voice. While this is not flawless, it works pretty good! It is on the bleeding edge so some challenges are to be expected. The apps for Echo appear to be growing, I just hope development continues. Next on list would be the harmony controller so that I can start to ingrate TV and Audio controls using Echo! At this time Sonos appears to be a challenge and a personal server appears to be the only option. Would recommend purchase! Help to keep the community growing! Make recommendations and comments on the apps you use!",positive
5342,5.0,"Amazon Echo so great, I have it running my air and lamps. performs great. Great product. Just ask a question and she gives the answer 99% of time correctly.",positive
5343,5.0,"I saw this come up on the deal of the day and didn't know it's capabilities.Connected in less than 1 minute to my wireless network and it was up and running. The microphones pick up my voice from across the room and I can even connect the blue tooth speaker to my apple products iPhone and iPad! Has huge music playback from all the services, Pandorra , iHeart, Amazon Prime and others. I haven't even used 10% of its capabilities. I also control my remote Ecobee3 thermostats. Waiting for the next deal of the day so I can get a few more of these for upcoming Holiday and Birthday gifts!",positive
5344,5.0,"Best device ever, don't' use my Bose radio any more",positive
5345,5.0,Very easy setup via smartphone App. Easy to use. Like the shopping list feature.,positive
5346,4.0,This was discounted on Best Buy better than Amazon. It is a great device and even better $50 off,positive
5347,5.0,This Echo is very cool. Great sound and ease of use makes this a great buy!,positive
5348,3.0,"Takes to many requests for Alexa to understand what you want. Have to ask several different ways to get most radio stations. When you ask for Rush Limbaugh, you get country music stations. Alexa must be sending me a message.",negative
5349,5.0,"I was one of the original Amazon Echo purchasers, and have loved using it ever since. I bought this one as a ""thank you"" gift for my wonderful brother-in-law, who baby-sat me through two cataract surgeries. He loves it too.",positive
5350,3.0,"Amazon echo dosent hear well when the music is on full blast, but when you do get thru she's very acurate .",negative
5351,5.0,I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES GADGETS.,positive
5352,5.0,We use it for songs alarm and ask anything. It constantly updates from cloud and so every week it's learning something new,positive
5353,5.0,amazon keeps adding more feature - it willl be light years ahead of google home when it comes out,positive
5354,5.0,This device has already been used by all of my family for fun and looking up school information,positive
5355,4.0,It took a couple days to learn to do small things on the echo. After going online and looking up various questions I'm really beginning to enjoy it. I like it so much I bought one for my son. Looking forward to learning and using it more. Just wish more information came with it as far as using it.,positive
5356,5.0,Excellent speakers for this price range. Combines Bluetooth playback and streaming services. Alexa voice commands are a very convenient way to navigate and get general information.,positive
5357,5.0,Information and music and all you have to do is ask! Alexa is amazing!,positive
5358,5.0,"The Amazon Echo is awesome. It is VERY easy to set up. I mostly play pandora music, but it works with Amazon music and Audible.",positive
5359,5.0,"Very cool and lots of features, I can play just about any song as a prime member, just say ""Alexa, play...."" or set timer for and set alarm for...I heard there are these modules and light bulbs the Echo can control. In the near future a device like this will be the center of your home controlling security, TV, heat/air, lights....so cool. Until then I love my Echo",positive
5360,5.0,Excellent for someone who is alone at home and needs company. Very entertaining.,positive
5361,5.0,Alexa is neat and once mastered many possibilities are opened.,positive
5362,5.0,Saw the TV commercials for this product and then bought it as a gift for a friend who likes technology.,positive
5363,5.0,"This is my second Echo purchase. I use ""Alexa"" while getting ready in the morning. Instead of looking for a clock, I ask ""Alexa"" for the time 20 times in the morning.I use the Echo to set alarms, and to listen to news/music. The Echo can also play books via Audible. Oh! I also use my Echo to control my lights. Buy the Echo. It's usefulness is endless.",positive
5364,3.0,"I like Alexa, but limited. Can't connect with I-Tunes account yet. Can only set a one time alarm with 24 hours and cannot make it recurring. I see improvements weekly, but still a long way to go.",negative
5365,4.0,"Has a great alarm clock functionality -- know that sounds silly but it's awesome to be able to set your alarm with your voice. And you can play music before bedtime and put on a sleep timer, which is awesome.The news roundups in the morning are also nice for while you get ready.Interested to see where it goes!",positive
5366,5.0,"Fairly easy to set up. Once running, it was fun to begin seeing what Alexa could do. I look forward to using it every day. My wife uses it more than I, loves to listen to C&W music while sewing.",positive
5367,5.0,"Good sound, learns more as you use it, can tell reasonably corny jokes, and Amazon come up with a new app almost weekly. Future is great for it. Got it on sale......if I could get that price again, I might get another one.",positive
5368,5.0,"When Best Buy put it on their Deal of the Day, I jumped on it. It does so much and is very easy to set up and use. I've had it for 2 months and I'm still exploring all of the things it does. It just keeps getting better and better every week... Just go to your Alexa app, on your phone or tablet and see what's new this week.",positive
5369,5.0,"Works great and constantly updated and improving. I use it to turn on my lights, my fan and adjust my two thermostats. I also ask it to play my favorite talk radio and more. Will pick up more for other parts of the house.",positive
5370,5.0,"Every household should have one of these! It is great for music...does so much more. I am in process of making my home ""smart"" and it works lots of the smart home devices (all that I have purchased so far!) Must have in any family!",positive
5371,4.0,What a cool speaker. Alexa is fun to use and the sound is great.,positive
5372,5.0,A great blessing for all sorts of information. 10 minutes to setup... unbelievable amount of information and assistance.,positive
5373,5.0,I now have voice controlled home using my echo and smart devices! Listening to any song I like in seconds using my Amazon Prime is probably the thing I love the best! We put it in our kitchen which is central to our living space and echo picks up all of our commands from any room downstairs!,positive
5374,5.0,A great way to make the web easier to use. Love it!,positive
5375,5.0,"This is the second unit placed in my home. You will be a little withdrawn at first but once you get answers from the unit, you will love it. I recommend you use the training to your voice when you first set the unit up. Do not hesitate to learn what the Echo can do.",positive
5376,4.0,Was skeptical about this until it went on sale and we finally bought it. Gretat for home automation and music. Only disappointment is that we couldn't pair with another speaker.,positive
5377,5.0,At first wasn't so sure about getting the Echo. Finally after reading reviews and the things it could do I bought one. So far it has worked great and looking forward to being able to continue to expand its capabilities and help smart wire my house.,positive
5378,5.0,Works great couldn't be happier! Puts out great sound!,positive
5379,5.0,"I now have 3 Bedroom,kitchen and shower area and I will be getting one for the media room in the future. I think that says it all. The only down side is since it's operations is in the cloud, if Amazons servers go down then it's a brick but you can connect to Bluetooth on the phone and also use it as a Bluetooth speaker. There is one thing they could fix and that is when the volume is up high then if you try to talk to the Echo, it can't hear you and you'll have to manually turn it down.",positive
5380,4.0,"Your music, Pandora, etc, alarms, weather.. The entire family loves the echo and its various uses. Easy to set up and start using.",positive
5381,5.0,User friendly the best speaker this year recommend to all my friends,positive
5382,4.0,"I bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house. I also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree. The sound quality is good. The noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume. Only downside is no battery operation (it must always be plugged in). Also, even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone, you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls (Only music). For IOT toys its fun for voice control (ex: nest, etc). The skills are mostly cheesy though. Fun toy that allows easy access to prime music, pandora, etc.",positive
5383,5.0,I got this as a gift and I must say the sound is better than my Bose speaker. I not only listen to music but it turns my lamp on when I ask. Alexa also can give me the traffic report as well as weather she tells jokes and many more things. I think everyone should have one of these!!,positive
5384,5.0,The echo has a great sound for a small product. The convenience alone makes this a worthwhile purchase.,positive
5385,5.0,"Exciting for the family entertainment, enjoying all music",positive
5386,4.0,SO simple and easy to u se. It answers a multitude of questions and plays my favorite music. Portable and unobtrusive when not in use.,positive
5387,5.0,"In the past I used Google for information that I needed, but now I just ask Alexa! It's more versatile than Siri and it's ready to go just my saying her name. Yes, it's a little bit of a toy, but then what electronics aren't?",positive
5388,5.0,"So far, I have used my Echo as a Bluetooth speaker. I have not interact with the device with my Amazon account (turning it off when not being use as a speaker).",positive
5389,5.0,"Ok, so I will not say its perfect but it is really close, I bought it for my wife to have endless music... Yes its great.... But then I connected it to my home automation and I will say it really nice not to have to get up to turn on or off light in a room again...Constant updates keep me interested.",positive
5390,4.0,Lots of fun direct Alexa. Just need to be very direct with wording of commands. Continue to improve with software iterations.,positive
5391,5.0,This thing is awesome! Makes life a little bit simpler,positive
5392,5.0,"I use this for playing music, alarms and control a few smart home devices. Great to see everything works flawless.",positive
5393,5.0,"Alexa is so much more than a gateway to Amazon services. We use the Echo for music, cooking timers, controlling the lights of our home. The best is when the kids add items to our Alexa shopping list. Makes it super easy to build a grocery list.Super easy to set up. Works great. You should have one in your home.",positive
5394,5.0,"I'll admit that I sometimes think of this as the computer on ""Star Trek"" but I appreciate the wit of some of the responses. Like when I asked, ""Alexa, did you miss me?""",positive
5395,5.0,I have my Echo setup in my kitchen as that is where I get the most use of it. There is a learning curve to figuring out its limitations and getting it setup though. After that it is a fun device to use like I can add things to my grocery list or play a podcast or play Prime Music or turn on lights or give me the weather and sports scores. I am slowing setting my home up to have connected devices and this was a great starting device. I would say if you have spotty internet service this thing will not work but when you are on DSL you get what you pay for right?,positive
5396,5.0,"We were searching for a speaker and considered one which would be louder, but the Echo does so much. She is a speaker, but also a shopping list, whole-home control, encyclopedia, news source, etc. I would definitely recommend.",positive
5397,5.0,Once you learn some of the invocations - it becomes easier to have Alexa reply to your command/requests.,positive
5398,5.0,Bought on a whim because it was at Prime Day pricing. Pretty cool. Still getting used to all its features. Nice that it gets updated very often.,positive
5399,5.0,She does what I ask of her for now. I haven't really gotten a chance to open up all her abilities due to the fact I don't have other smart things. She plays my music tell me my weather and what is on my to do list.,positive
5400,4.0,"There will be a learning curve when you take it out of the box. Once you learn the correct way to say a command, it is nice unit to use. And those jokes - they're groaners that will bring a smile to your face. Sleep timer is a nice feature. ""Alexa"" does not like it when you speak in a loud voice - you must talk to her in a normal voice.",positive
5401,4.0,great device still needs little quirks worked out to be the device that i truly want it to be but overall great speak and it does its job,positive
5402,5.0,Alexa is like talking to ur self but with google knowledge and answers back,positive
5403,5.0,Love my Amazon echo. Works with my Wemo lights and nest thermostat. She also plays prime music.,positive
5404,5.0,"Sound quality excellent, functionality is smooth, App required a day or two for full comprehension. System works beautifully, my sons especially have enjoyed the lighting integration with our LIFX and the Amazon Prime Music requests. Will be expanding the system when ""Dot"" returns.",positive
5405,5.0,"This just is so much fun to use. So easy to ask for music to be played. Quality is good too. We ask about our sports teams and ask for jokes. We just sit and laugh at how this works. We are just starting to use it for our shopping list. We used to use OneNote, but it is so easy to ask Alexa to add a product to the shopping list. She repeats it and has always gotten it right.

5409,4.0,"Great sound and voice response, easy to set up and use.",positive
5410,1.0,I am an old guy and I am having trouble trying to get the unit up and running. I decided I really should return it but it was past the return date. It is back in the box waiting to find time to try one more time or put it on ebay.,negative

5416,5.0,"I'm a Bose fan, and the Bluetooth/WiFi Soundtouch 20 is wonderful for classical and jazz. However, I enjoy talking to ""Alexa"" and interacting with ""her"" to get weather info and jokes. The Echo is wonderful!",positive
5417,5.0,I Used rely on Siri on the iphone prior to buying this and do not use Siri anymore since I started using Alexa. I activate siri on my phone and address it as Alexa. The voice recognition is awesome compared to any other assistant like Siri. You can speak from any corner in the room and it will capture it. I automated my home with this and we love it.,positive
5418,5.0,so much fun to use. Also streamlines ordering and other task. Great for listening to music as you think of it.,positive
5419,5.0,I love this speaker so much! This speaker has outperformed every other speaker I have purchased! Alexa has great voice recognition and kicks Siri's butt it in this area!,positive

5422,3.0,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",negative
5423,4.0,What great interactive features...understands commands very well except when music is loud. Why not add a digital or analog output so it can be used in conjunction with your home audio as well?,positive
5424,4.0,Expectations exceeded on this. Works great. Very happy with it.,positive
5425,5.0,I love Alexa! Don't tell my wife. She listens and she gives me answers without questioning my motives.,positive

5435,4.0,"I bought this to control lights and play music from pandora, Amazon prime and phone. Works very well. Alexa response is acceptable but not as good as 'Okay Google'",positive
5436,5.0,"the amazon echo is a wonderful piece of technology. She tells jokes, plays music and you can play games with her too. there are more practical uses as well. She can control your wifi enabled household devices, like turning lights on or adjusting the AC. The equipment to do that is still pretty pricey, but she is good just for entertainment. The only bad part is, she can't push audio out to my bluetooth speakers. I think the DOT can but not the echo.",positive
5437,5.0,Does everything I wanted it to do with very few errors.,positive
5438,4.0,"I got the Echo for my elderly dad who has poor vision and has difficulty using his computer. It's great, now he can ask Alexa whatever he wants to know! We have an issue with his wifi though, he has DSL through frontier and it is poor at times. So sometimes Alexa doesn't work. You know she didn't hear you because she has a blue light when she hears her name. dad is not patient, so we'll see if he still enjoys Alexa if she isn't entirely dependable.",positive
5439,4.0,"I bought this speaker for my nephew , he is 25 and he loved it. It is a great speaker. It can understand most commands. Sound quality is very good. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a rechargeable battery. It has to be plugged in all the time , no battery.",positive

5441,4.0,This is a great toy for now I am just learning the infinite number of things I can do with Echo.,positive
5442,5.0,"Love this item, it is absolutely amazing for you home.",positive
5443,4.0,"I looked into many reviews before buyin this device bec I wasn't convince at first, twas initially offered by Amazon for $199 then with Prime for $99 but missed all those deals bec it was a newcomer in the gadget arena so I waited for awhile but should've grab it when it was launched bec Alexa is just amazing and makes u a bit of a master by his good capture voice commands, ask anything and it will answer the best way it can, maximize with Prime membership and u have a great music entertainment! Great Buy!!",positive
5444,5.0,"Great product, and works flawlessly with home automation. At first I was a huge skeptic about needing an always on device. However after buying an echo earlier this year from amazon, I have become an avid user. So much so that I bought a second one from best buy once they began carrying them! Also per-ordered their amazon dot, which is $49. Order one now, you will not be disappointed!",positive
5445,4.0,"Awesome speaker, love that I can talk to it and it responds well",positive
5446,4.0,"Not quite as accurate as the commercials imply, but good for music and ""parlor"" tricks like asking sillly questions.",positive

5448,5.0,"Great sound quality, amazing microphone. Very cool experience to come home, tell ""Alexa"" to turn on the lights and play music from spotify. Well worth the price.",positive
5449,5.0,Prime integration is smooth and voice recognition is much better than Siri,positive
5450,4.0,"Got this for my parents to allow my dad to bring music into his family room,. I own both the echo and thee Dot. Love the simplicity of the personal assistant. Connected to my Hue lights, and nest thermostat. Alexa allows my wife to control our lights, play music or get a flash briefing via voice commands. Speaker is Pretty good for a stand alone unit. Voice recognition is very good. If you have home automation devices like hue, wink, nest or othe, the Echo makes them better than ever",positive
5451,5.0,"We were curious about the Echo for a while, but not entirely sure how it was supposed to complement the household. Now, we know! In ways that didn't even dawn on us initially, Echo and ""Alexis"" have become a steadfast companion and assistant at the house. I'd highly recommend it!",positive
5452,5.0,Purchased the Alexa to act as a vocal head to my smart home setup. It does this very well. She will tell you the weather on command and plays music too. Can also act as a bluetooth speaker.,positive
5453,5.0,I got this to control my Hue lightbulbs and it works great. Surprised at how fast it is!,positive
5454,5.0,"My husband, kids and I have enjoy Alexa very much. Having her play music without us lifting a finger is my daughter's favorite feature.",positive

5456,5.0,I love the echoI'm really enjoying all of it's features!,positive
5457,4.0,"Very nice assistant, except for the alexa commands are just in english",positive
5458,5.0,"Didn't think I would get much out of this but I already had hue lights, harmony remote and august smart lock. Alexa controls all of them! She is also a cool companion giving my news and sports update in the morning while I make my coffee. Mindfulness minutes are great when paired with Apple Watch app of the same name.",positive
5459,5.0,I first thought I would never need something like this but ever day I used it more and more.,positive
5460,3.0,"It's a fun little toy but lacks practicality. In order to make it user friendly, I recommend a battery for it. You will also need Amazon prime in order for the music to play worth a darn. Otherwise you will be stuck searching through your phone for your song.",negative
5461,5.0,"I bought this thing thinking it's a cool little gadget. But I have to admit, she has the ability to do a lot of things. It's like Siri on steroids! With the appropriate items, she's able to turn on/off lights, order things through Amazon and they just announced that she will soon be able to interact with the bmw i3! The kids especially love it, they just wish she can do their homework!",positive
5462,5.0,the echo helps me keep tract of daily and monthy events..Hoping later to use it to play music and use it to make the house more efficent.,positive
5463,4.0,"i am happy with my purchase of alexa, it is user friendly aand easy to learn i also find it convienient and time saveing in its ability to adapt, has some quirks but nothing major overall a joy toown and use.",positive
5464,4.0,"Amazon Echo is a great product. Gives you information (news, music, restaurants...), turns on appliances, lights and more. Highly recommended for the techie in your family.",positive
5465,4.0,Got this to use with my SmartThings home automation system. Use voice commands from the Echo to trigger automation. Much more convenient than getting your phone out and loading the SmartThings app. Sometimes it has a hard time understanding what I say.,positive
5466,5.0,"I absolutely love Alexa. It's the best purchase that I've made in a long time. She's so handy and funny too! I love that I can ask her to play my music, ask for a recipe, ask about the weather all within the comfort of my couch!! I'd recommend this baby to everyone!",positive
5467,5.0,"This is my second Amazon echo, I now have one in the bedroom and living area. I work from home so this as become my personal assistant. It's amazing what you can do out of the box but if you like to tinker you can write your own skills and extend the feature set. One of those devices that you wonder how you lived with out it.",positive
5468,5.0,Installed the Echo in to my house that we have Nest thermostats in and WeMo light switches its interfaces with those devices are flawlessly. I can ask Echo to turn on or off lights or set the temperature on my thermostats. It does too many things to list. The voice recognition is the best I have used on any product.,positive
5469,5.0,"I think Alexa is great. We first saw it while visiting family and were intrigued. We used our Best Buy point, so the risk was minimal. Alexa is great at answering questions related to whether, sporting events, calendar, shopping and todo lists. I like that I can print out my todo and shopping lists and that she can add events to my online calendar. We haven't even scratched the surface and we love Alexa already!! We also decided to join Amazon prime and are very satisfied so far...keep up the good work Amazon!!",positive
5470,5.0,This is something I bought for a gift. They wanted this and as of now she loves it. I am considering buying one for myself,positive

5473,5.0,My family enjoys the capabilities of the echo. Ask it anything and listen to anything anytime,positive
5474,4.0,"This was purchased as a gift for my son. Now I'm thinking of getting two more, one for me and one for my other son. So need I say more. If I had this in my own home I probably would have given it 5 stars. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't used it first hand",positive
5475,5.0,"Love the sound. Plays my Pandora, Answers all my questions no matter how off the wall",positive
5476,5.0,"I just love the Amazon Echo. It does so many things that I've almost started to take them for granted. From the time I get up in the morning or when I get home from work Alexis is ready. First thing in the morning I ask about the weather and a synopsis of the news. I have her play music while I'm getting ready for work. I can set a timer if I'm cooking or to remind me it's time to leave. If a question pops into my head I can ask Alexis. If I want to know what's on my calendar for the day, I ask Alexis. Where have you been all my life?",positive
5477,4.0,Very cool to be able to give voice instructions and get news and music via voice. Works great,positive
5478,4.0,"Needed speaker system for office music and the Echo is very easy to set up syncing with my iPhone by adding the Alexa App. Took maybe 5 minutes from opening box to playing Pandora on it. Have built in speakers in our house but they connect to CD player, radio or cable music channels but I wanted something that I could easily control the genre and this is it!",positive
5479,5.0,we have hooked up to the whole home and it will take care of anything we ask it works great and does so much.,positive
5480,5.0,"We have so enjoyed our Echo. It helps me with my calendar, spells words for us, tells us the weather, etc.",positive
5481,5.0,"I have implemented several smart devices throughout our home like Nest thermostats, a Sonos controller, WeMo switches, a Dropcam HD camera and a Ring doorbell. The Echo is quickly becoming the smart hub to control many of these devices. Setup was quick and easy. Integration with my Pandora and Spotify accounts was a breeze. Now I just need to patiently wait for my Echo to beginning offering Sonos control.",positive
5482,3.0,Responds quickly. Hears my command from quite a distance. If you buy into google schedule (monthly fee) it helps you keep track of appointments birthdays etc.,negative
5483,5.0,Whole family is enjoying it! Kids and we are both able to use and user friendly.,positive
5484,5.0,Easy to use and fun. It's become a part of the family routine.,positive
5485,5.0,Somewhat awkward to setup in Canada but once done it is an amazing source of useful features. Enjoy the link to my Spotify subscription and some of the new apps that are created for the Echo. It even has a sense of humour and sharp answers to stupid questions. Well worth the price.,positive
5486,5.0,Great product! This is the best smart device that we have bought in so many years. The best of it is Alexa is getting better every day. We are having fun with Alexa every day me she became one of the best friends of my wife.,positive

5492,5.0,Bought this for my dad. I like this Amazon product very much.,positive
5493,4.0,I got this because I was interested about the technology. Now I have it read me the news every morning and set an alarm to wake me up.,positive
5494,4.0,"The product is great once you download everything you need. I found it a little challenging taking it from place to place. It must connect to Wi-Fi to work and be loaded with the music you want to hear. It's great for your favorite spot in your home or office, then download songs, and don't move it.",positive
5495,5.0,Can't believe how smooth it works.Highly recommend it.,positive
5496,5.0,This is a great speaker and easy to use. It is really user friendly.,positive

5502,4.0,Is a good product but I will like to know more about it,positive
5503,5.0,"Very convenient, not perfect but worth the money for sure.",positive
5504,4.0,"Ok. So it's super cool being able to just talk to something that's right there in the kitchen and ask questions, set a timer, check the news or even listen to music. You just have to get over the freak out of who else might be able to listen in if hackers find a way!",positive
5505,5.0,"Love being able to make my shopping list, listen to news. weather, playlists, and more. I am finding new ways , each day , to use it.",positive
5506,5.0,"Great device. Makes things so easy when you can just tell out what you want to hear, or ask our questions...especially while cooking, our if your hands are full. Have integrated out with the Philips hue bulbs and love it.",positive
5507,5.0,"I like this because it plays all prime music on Amazon and all you have to do is tell Alexa what you would like to hear and it will play it for you. We use it by our pool all the time and the kids have instant music. I use it daily for the weather, and I always know how to dress for the day. I am constantly learning more and more from Alexa.",positive
5508,5.0,"Amazon did it again, Alexa is awesome and controls my lights, music, can ask her questions and works great with IFTT",positive

5512,5.0,"This is a lot of fun. It makes access to news, music, and home automation easy and a lot of fun.",positive
5513,5.0,"We got this on a one-day special and took a chance. I would say that Alexa generally works better than Siri on most things and more consistently. The speaker alone is good, but the ability to play radio via TuneIN, Pandora, Amazon Music, etc. is value enough...beyond the little things like saying ""Alexa, set a timer for 4 minutes"" or ""Alexa, what's the weather going to be like?"". Overall very impressed with the Echo - recommended highly.",positive
5514,5.0,Sound is crisp. Alexa is always on point. We love it.,positive
5515,4.0,"The echo works well, has good sound and is an interesting concept. Where it falls short is in the quality of the search results. It often responds that it doesn't understand the question or does not have information about what is asked. I have returned and will purchase the Google home system when it is released.",positive
5516,5.0,"Alexa is very useful at home. It helps you to play music, set up time, checklists to do, etc",positive
5517,5.0,"A must have for music lovers. Alexa has enabled me to play Amazon prime music as well as Pandora, etc. I love the hands free operation. I am learning how to use Alexa to find out information and other new things. LOVE it.......",positive
5518,5.0,"I love my Alexa! She plays music when I ask her, she answers questions when I ask, and she turns my lights on and off. 5 stars!!",positive
5519,5.0,The echo is pretty fun to use but is definitely more useful when paired with other smart home devices. I can control my Lifx bulb and my Ecobee smart thermostat with voice commands. She's also programmed with some funny lines and is fun to chat with to see what she says.,positive
5520,4.0,I have owned the echo for about a month now and it has worked great. Connects directly to the internet and also streams music from major streaming services and allows connections from Bluetooth. You can also download skills which gives it added functionality. It can do so many things that it is taking me time to explore the limits of its capabilities great product..,positive
5521,4.0,Great product and Best Buy was the best place to purchase from.,positive
5522,5.0,Echo is the best way to have any songs (over a million) with just one command to Alexa. All the many features make for a wonderful piece of technology enjoyed by all ages. So helpful and entertaining!!!Love it!,positive
5523,5.0,"I bought the Echo and a few Hue light bulbs when the radio that I use to listen to NPR new in the morning died on me. I've been very happy. I didn't even have to set it up to find my radio station! I just said, ""Alexa, listen to 88.9 FM,"" and she did it. Just like that. My kids ask her to check their math problems for their homework. We use her to check the weather before getting dressed in the morning. The lighting set up was super easy. Alexa is a nice addition to our family.",positive
5524,5.0,I really like the Echo device. Still learning how to get the most out of this technology. Wish you could make and receive calls from this device.,positive
5525,5.0,Easy to set up and connects without issues. Add a few wifi switches and skills and you have a voice activated smart house. Plus you can talk to Alexa and not feel lonely.,positive
5526,5.0,I can get rid of the old stereo/radio in my family room. I use it all the time.,positive
5527,4.0,"Echo is a nice addition to my ahem becoming automated home (not close). What I like with it are easy to use and setup, there still a lot of improvement to do but overall it's nice to have it as long the maker of it will continue to update Alexa to keep up with.this fast paced technology of us.",positive
5528,5.0,Unbelievable how smooth it is. Great product.. soon would be must have for all.,positive
5529,5.0,"Very handy gadget to have at home. Use frequently to play subtle background music, get weather forcast, or add items to a shopping list. Can order items on Amazon or put them in shopping cart. Has been a great purchase. Highly recommend. Great sound by the way.",positive
5530,4.0,The Echo is easy to use but some features require a lot of work. It is easy to set up for playing music. The other features(skills) require some study to get the most out of the product. After a few months I am still learning something everyday about the Echo. Long learning curve but a fun product.,positive
5531,4.0,The Echo is a fun new tool to easily interface with the information highway. But there is a learning curve to navigate in order to be able to get the most out of the Echo. Sometimes Echo does not understand your requests. So you have to be able to restate certain requests.,positive
5532,4.0,"Takes getting use to asking the questions in the right way. Alexa is still learning so at times can be frustrating when asking questions. Great for music, weather, dates, and schedule requests. Its an entertaining companion when your home and enjoying some private time.",positive
5533,5.0,"Now I will admit I am a tech gal. I did do some investigations before buying. I was not dissapointed at all. This is like your own personal assistant. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, spell,set alarm,check weather,traffic,news update,even tells jokes. I love the fact that anyone can talk to it and it will still work. My family and friends have pure entertainment with this neat gadget. I look forward to seeing more things added to the commands. Also was super easy to set up and the volume is way better than expected.",positive
5534,3.0,"I thought it would do more, eg. be able to integrate with my cell phone to make calls or send text messages",negative
5535,5.0,Simple to use. Easily customized. Great speakers. Responds quickly. Responds to any voice. Tells good jokes. Turns on lamp for me when asked so can have light to see when entering house,positive
5536,5.0,Alexa has changed our lives...get one...get one now,positive
5537,5.0,"Purchase echo as a gift. Owned mine for over a year and still learning from it..Planning on teaming it up with a couple of dots, great tchnology.",positive

5541,5.0,Voice recognition has come a long way. Really amazed at how well it works.,positive
5542,2.0,"Not sure what all the hype is about, this AI is remedial at best. It responds with the exact same answer to vastly different questions. Not intuitive at all. Save your money.",negative
5543,5.0,I really enjoy today's electronic gadgets and this is a really nice addition to my collection.,positive
5544,4.0,This is a good product for a beginner who likes technology.,positive
5545,5.0,Love it. Exactly what I needed for home automation.,positive
5546,5.0,"Alexa is like Siri for home. I love it! I play songs cleaning the house or play different genres for get togethers. She plays corny jokes that are funny, too. Anything you ask she pretty much knows. I recommend definitely.",positive
5547,3.0,This is a neat little device but really not that good for much. I am sure it will improve in the future but I would recommend waiting it out.,negative
5548,5.0,Everything and more that I imagined!! LOVE LOVE LOVE my echo,positive

5556,5.0,"I'm so excited when I got Alexa. She is hands free assistance. While I'm cleaning, I can speak commands to her or just ask questions. It's amazing how you can dual task.

I would definitely recommend this.",positive
5557,5.0,"The echo is great. Besides information,it will handle smart lights. It's learning new things all the time.",positive
5558,5.0,"Use to do everyday questions. What's the time,weather,addtoo shop list, check calendar and all kinds of little things without having to open computer lying in bed.",positive
5559,5.0,"Primarily use as a music player. Voice recognition is a+++. Now I just have to figure out which devices I would like to control with Alexia (we use ""echo""). Plenty of user created apps available to transfer results for commands like calendar and reminders to my smartphone so I don't have to depend on the Amazon smartphone app.",positive
5560,3.0,"A little disappointed with my first experience with AI. You have to learn to communicate with Alexa to get results. I feel like she should have to learn more about me than I her. However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy. She does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill/Application.",negative
5561,3.0,It's a pretty good device but still has some issues with voice recognition,negative
5562,4.0,"I waited to buy this product, to see what the reviews would have to say over time. They were mostly upbeat, and I am an Amazon Prime member. So, I said, ""What the heck,"" and gave the Echo a shot. I am glad I did. I use it to listen to music and news intermittently throughout the night while sleeping. I enjoy the Sports Update and the Flash Briefing. I also like that I can simply ask to stream most any radio station, and listen to the latest episode of my favorite pod casts. Echo is very responsive to my voice commands. This product is easily worth every penny you spend on it.",positive
5563,5.0,Loved Alexa. This gadget is so handy and easy to use.,positive
5564,5.0,"Very intuitive to use, works great with the Amazon ecosystem.",positive
5565,5.0,"I'd been looking for a decent table radio for a very long time. Best Buy had a Deal-of-the-Day on these and I thought, what the heck, here's a table radio you can talk to. It does a whole lot more than that, and there is quite a learning curve, not so much in how to use it, but to learn what all is available for it and then how to make that functionality useful. The sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station I can play tons of stuff from Prime Music online and add skills whenever I need them from the skills store. (All the skills I've seen so far are free so ""store"" is kind of a loose term.) It responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than Siri or Cortana. With all the alarms, timers, shipment trackers, wall street reports, entertainment updates, etc, it's like living with a gifted, less snooty concierge. I like it and would buy another if this one ever broke.",positive
5566,5.0,My wife and I really enjoy the Echo. We use it to stream music and the daily news feed as well as turn on some lights. The sound is very good and fills the room(s) we have it in and near.,positive
5567,5.0,Purchased this to get updates on weather and stock market but found many more uses. Many different apps to add during setup. And she tells jokes too.,positive
5568,5.0,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday, and she loves it! It is so easy to operate, and has so much in its library for music!",positive
5569,4.0,"It's a nice gadget. Sometimes though it cannot understand what I'm wanting her to do. But the more you use it, the better it gets.",positive
5570,5.0,Amazing that Amazon beats Apple at the voice recognition game. Great product.,positive
5571,5.0,Alexa is very understanding and knows how to please,positive
5572,5.0,"This device does everything. I get news, jokes, stock quotes, sports scores, etc. Plus it maintains my shopping list",positive
5573,5.0,"It's a good addition to the gadgets. Alexa helps manage shopping lists, connects to phone using Bluetooth to play music apart from the music on Amazon Prime. Alexa has a pretty good collection of jokes and can keep kids at home entertained.I plan on purchasing Hue range of lights that can be controlled using Echo soon.",positive
5574,5.0,There are many things I love about the Amazon Echo. It reads me the news every morning. News that is tailored to my interests. It will do simple calculations or set reminders and alarms. But most importantly it interfaces with my Smartthings hub and allows me to control all the lights and electrical devices in my house as well as the temperature with my voice.,positive
5575,4.0,Can't really speak for myself because I bought it as a gift. The recipient enjoys it. No complains,positive
5576,5.0,"A lot faster than Siri, very responsive and helpful in the kitchen playing music Multiple timers and measurements",positive
5577,4.0,I like this!! Its pretty cool it has a huge music library,positive
5578,5.0,Great sounding device. Product improvements are constantly being done & more options are being added.,positive
5579,5.0,"This is a great product, and I would recommend it to everyone. My kids love it more than my wife and I.",positive
5580,5.0,"Awesome gadget to have in the household. Even more of a plus when you link it to all the supporting smart devices like nest, etc",positive
5581,5.0,Read a lot about my product and would only purchase at Best Buy,positive
5582,5.0,"From Out the Box she was Absolutely Wroth the Money, A perfect Addition to my Tech And Home!!!!",positive
5583,4.0,Bought it for my mother. She works at a beauty salon so she's always busy. Echo works great for her. She loves it. Works great on her galaxy s7,positive
5584,4.0,"Works well, loud, and constant updates.Helpful for home automation products like hue lights.",positive
5585,3.0,"It did some things really well, like setting alarms and playing music, but there were too many times I would ask Alexa a question and she would respond saying she didn't know. I ended up returning it. Great promise, I just don't know that it is there yet.",negative
5586,5.0,Now I am able to integrate my smart home devices. Works like a charm. Alexa is still developing her skills but she's keeping me entertained. Job well done Amazon.,positive
5587,5.0,Echo is wonderful. It understands spoken language very well. I love how it's compatible with IFTTT. It can do just about anything.,positive
5588,5.0,"Very capable wireless bluetooth speaker, but the real genius is the awe inspiring voice recognition. It blows away Siri and other voice assistants. There is something really magical about using your voice as a computer interface. Constant over the air updates mean that this device gains new functionality every week.",positive
5589,4.0,"I haven't had the Echo for very long, so I'll need to spend more time on its capabilities. I've used it primarily for music. Alexa's great at understanding my requests - when they're from Amazon Prime music or music I purchased through Amazon. I've struggled so far with trying to get her to play music from my extensive I-Tunes music - even though I have an IPod Touch paired with the Echo. I'll have to keep trying.I've also used Alexa for setting timers and some basic questions. She's not very good at some questions - especially if they're too long. Anyway, I look forward to playing with Alexa some more. So far, I'm happy with my purchase.",positive
5590,4.0,Awesome little device.. use it to control zwave lights with voice ... sometimes it has a hard time picking up my voice but other than that it is awesome,positive
5591,5.0,"Amazon echo is simply an amazing product. I was able to set it up in minutes. In addition to all of the normal stuff you see on TV commercials it also integrates well with with all of my existing gadgets (Nest thermostats, Rachio sprinklers, Fitbit, Security system, Harmony remote hub, etc through IFTTT. My wife loves watering her flowers outside just by asking Alexa. The only thing I am really mad about is that it's now $20 than I bought it from Best Buy 4 days ago.",positive
5592,5.0,"Amazon echo better known as Alexa is much more than a smart speaker. To unlock its true music potential, one should have amazon prime. Great at understanding basic questions, Alexa will also give you news briefs and play music via amazon, Pandora and Spotify membership. The true joy of Alexa is its home automation commands via smartthings, hue, nest, etc. Highly recommended for those seeking more than just a smart speaker with decent mono sound.",positive
5593,5.0,"Alexa is not only fun to ask questions to, but she also tells jokes, weather, news, TV programs, how to spell a word, sports updates and any thing else you can think of. She is a hands free google. You can even have her send flowers for you. More and more aps are coming available. I love listening to either Pandora or Iheart radio, the sound quality is very good. We also have our lamp hooked up so she can turn this off and on when you tell her to.",positive
5594,5.0,One of the best products on the market.its amazing how well the Echo works.The technology that its using is some of the best I've ever used only Siri is better. I lover everything about well worth the money a I give it five stars.,positive
5595,4.0,"I bought this primarily to play music and control remote outlets I have around the house. It works great for both things!Alexa, play my playlist. Alexa, turn the fishtank on.It's terrible at specific search type questions, but I don't use it for that.",positive
5596,5.0,"Easy, intuitive set up. Excited to see new updates.",positive
5597,5.0,"So far the echo has been great...but there is a limited amount of skill and a lot of them are very useless. Once I add the accessories tonmake my home ""smarter"" I can get more use out of it. The speakers are incredible. Hope to have one or a dot in more rooms.",positive
5598,5.0,"this is a great item-- great speaker, can sync it up to your lights, etc",positive
5599,4.0,"The Echo is everything I thought it would be. Easy to set up, easy to use, loud, and many extra features you can link with. The timer and grocery list features are awesome. Voice commands for Pandora are cool as well.",positive
5600,5.0,Love this device!! Easy to set up and fun to use. Highly recommend.,positive
5601,5.0,"This was easy to set up. Easier to have your Hue lights already in place and then run ""discovery"". I watched You tube videos before setting up and it was not hard at all. Need to download the free app Amazon Echo. It connected with Philips hue lights. To connect with my nest thermostat I needed the IFTTT app. (Echo sends your command via the IFTTT app to nest. Thinking about getting another for other room.",positive
5602,5.0,"Love, love, love her. Looking forward to expanding on the abilities.",positive
5603,5.0,I absolutely love my echo because I am lazy to log on my computer to ask google. Also I get multi use of it as my personal Pandora music box. The only downside to this is Alexa can't hear you if your room is big because of echoing in the background....also I forgot her name once and had to walk next to her to turn her off. Other than that...I love her!,positive
5604,5.0,The Echo is so much fun and versatile. It continues to grow with more apps that are constantly being developed.,positive
5605,4.0,"I love the voice response, it makes multitasking better! I could just say ""Alexa, volume 10"" it raises the volume all the way. The only bad thing is that it has to be connected to an outlet, so its not that portable and it is a bit heavy than expected. Other than that i love it",positive
5606,4.0,I wish it could stream music from my private NAS and not only from purchased online music sources. Need to buy hubs and other interfaces for it to control lights and heating,positive
5607,4.0,"Simple to setup, use and update. We listen to music 3x as much as we used to as a family since it is so easy to use Amazon prime music or Pandora.",positive
5608,4.0,"Fun to ask random questions, get news and weather. I also control my Phillips hue lights with it. Kind of a novelty right now but I'm looking forward to some good use I can put it to.",positive
5609,5.0,"We are using Alexa for many daily chores, music, weather, radio etc.",positive
5610,5.0,I was a little confused at first but with continued use it worked really well. I enjoy taking photos of my adventures.,positive
5611,4.0,It's a very cool device to have and control home items by voice. It's limited to its capabilities but updates to include things you wish it did like the recent add to calendar reminders and alarm. Love cutting on my lights on by voice (beats the clap on lol). It does have a hard time of hearing sometimes and I have to repeat myself and holler sometimes like its my kids.,positive
5612,5.0,The Echo is a very interesting item that is entertaining and fun,positive
5613,5.0,Gave this for a gift and they absolutely love it. Also purchased the stand so it won't tip over. Easy to use.,positive
5614,5.0,Alexis is very useful for many different fun apps.,positive
5615,5.0,"This is the best tech device for the home. It keeps one company and communicates with the owner. It might be a life saver for the single person, the lonely elderly, and the young that likes new technology.",positive
5616,5.0,"Amazon has been marekting this via emails to me for a while. Didn't think much of it at first until I found out this works well with home automation. I have almost every light in my home ""connected"" using a Smartthings hub. I look so cool to my friends that have never seen an Echo before. With a quick command I can turn on or off any of my connected lights one by one or use an IFTTT command to turn everything on or off. Yes, it works with IFTTT!!! You can get pretty creative with it. Having a multi-level home, I can command Echo/Alexa to unlock my front door after seeing who it is via my Ring doorbell :). This is one cool device for lazy people like me LOL. I use it to get the weather, traffic, sports scores (Go Warriors!), and create/add items to my shopping list. It plays music from numerous streaming music services but being a Prime Member and having used everything from Pandora to Spotify I find Prime Music the best for my taste in music. It's also free with my Prime Membership so I don't have to listen to ads or get stuck not being able to skip a song I don't particularly like. I've also just recently purchased the remote which is a great accessory. I leave the Echo in my dining room/kitchen area and I can send commands to Echo from my bedroom without a glitch. I can't wait for my Echo Dots to arrive. Call me an Echo fanatic but I tell you...it's an awesome piece of technology. And it keeps getting better as Amazon continues to develop and add new features. My only gripe is that I can't control my home security system with it. Simplisafe just doesn't want to play with anyone...boo!",positive
5617,4.0,"The echo is great for reporting the latest news, weather and playing music.",positive
5618,4.0,Great product but only as good as what you have to sync to it.,positive
5619,5.0,"cool gizmo, definitely a great gift for the person that has everything!",positive
5620,5.0,"This is a very cool item. The voice recognition does not work great when playing music, but still good product",positive
5621,5.0,"This is great toy. You may not need it, but you'll want it, and love it when you start using it.",positive
5622,5.0,"Amazon echo has been a great product. We are able to turn our lights on and off, get the news, sports and traffic and even schedule calendar events just by asking Alexa to perform the task. Love this product. Can't wait for further integration with our home.",positive
5623,5.0,I love the Amazon Echo so much I ordered two plus am planning on ordering the echo dot along with the nest thermostat 5 Switches that are Alexa enabled and the ecobee that is Alexa enabled. I would highly recommend them to friends and family.,positive
5624,5.0,The Amazon Echo is like Star Trek for the home because the Echo does what you command with your voice and new features are being added all the time. I like the size of the speaker and it has good sound too :-),positive
5625,4.0,The only thing missing is SONOS integration. When Amazon managed to allow for echo to be conected to an speaker system such as SONOS this product will be deserving of a 10 star.It does what is mean to do flawless.,positive
5626,5.0,"Great device to use, not essential home item but definitely a fun item to have.",positive
5627,5.0,One of the best products ever created! Love Alexa!,positive

5632,5.0,"this thing works great. it was simple to set up and has great sound. all of my Amazon prime music is available. we keep it downstairs where we watch tv so it is available. Now we need a ""spot"" for the kitchen. Set a timer, put items on the grocery list Etc.",positive
5633,5.0,Alexa is one smart device . she reminds me of appts. Controls my lighting.once I change my themostat she will make sure we are comfortable.,positive
5634,5.0,The Amazon Echo is their response to Siri in stereo. It has terrific voice recognition and constantly learns new things. The only shortcoming is that it doesn't play nicely with iTunes.,positive
5635,5.0,"The Amzon Echo is like a dream come true. Everyone in my house feels like we live in some future movie. We use it everyday to get our news, weather, cooking timer, control our lights, control our AC and listen to music over Spotify, all with just our voice. It's useful to get quick wiki info or even just for a joke. The kids love to play paper rock and scissors with her. My only regret is I don't have another!",positive
5636,5.0,It is so easy to use even my 4 year old has been using it!,positive
5637,5.0,The family love's asking questions. We also enjoy the shopping list and jokes.,positive
5638,4.0,The speaker is a really great convienence device. However my only gripe is that the speakers' sound warps at high volumes if there's a lot of bass.,positive
5639,5.0,I love this product and use it every day. Easy to set up and connect to,positive
5640,5.0,"It tells me news, weather and can listen to prime music.",positive
5641,5.0,"Echo is a great product on its own, but even better when integrated with home control like Wink. Voice control of lights is the way of the future!",positive
5642,5.0,Love it! Alexia is at your service. Love the ability to play a variety of music. Great product!,positive
5643,5.0,"Very easy setup. Works every time. I have my lights, AC and TV controlled by the echo.",positive
5644,5.0,"The best product to come out of Amazon. Just love my Echo, works well as smart hub",positive
5645,4.0,Received as a gift. Questions have to be asked in a certain way to be answered correctly. The sound is awesome. I can connect my iPhone by bluetooth to play music.,positive
5646,5.0,"After reading the reviews, it's an awesome gadget added to the collection!",positive
5647,5.0,The Amazon - Echo met my expectations for this product,positive
5648,5.0,"I love it so much, high recommend !Alexa will be your friends.",positive
5649,5.0,"Got this for my wife and she likes it. My boys love it even more! ""Alexa, tell me a joke..."" ""Alexa how big is the earth?""But when this is integrated with Prime, it is fantastic. From playing all Prime playlists to music in my library. She keeps tabs on our grocery lists. Tells us the traffic. Weather. Movie time listings (and where.)""Alexa, Thank you."" ""You're welcome, glad I could help.""",positive
5650,5.0,This thing is awesome!!! Its very easy to setup and fun to use. The speaker sounds amazing and the microphone is incredible. I wish my siri could understand me as clearly and accurately as Alexa does. I can't wait to expand my whole house automation!,positive
5651,5.0,"I read the reviews, watched the YouTube videos, did tons of research and talked myself into getting an Echo. I am so glad I did. It has been the most useful thing I've purchased in years, turning out to be one of the most fun ones, too. I get my news, weather, music and audio books with nothing more than a request to Alexa. I also control my Nest thermostat and Philips Hue lights with a request as well. I have my alarms set up through my Echo as well as my shopping list, to do list and about a hundred other things it seems. I love my Echo, I think you'll love it, too.",positive
5652,5.0,Got the Echo for my husband who just loves it. I think it has become his best friend,positive
5653,5.0,It's a positive addition to the household. I enjoy having Alexa.,positive
5654,5.0,"Amazing must have device, gets better with time as more and more ""skills"" are added. Able to listen to local sports radio, music, controlling your smart devices, etc. Great sound from the speaker as well....",positive
5655,3.0,"I purchased this item for the home automation integration. Its pretty cool for just saying ""Alexa, turn on my kitchen lights"". Integrates with all the large players in home automation, Wink, Smartthings, Philips Hue, etc. Its also works well as a bluetooth speaker, streaming from your phone or tablet. It also streams Pandora and radio stations via TuneIn.It doesn't do anything useful other than that, besides simple queries about weather, etc.",negative
5656,4.0,"Gotta love the character that Echo's Alexa has. She can be snarky from time to time depending on what you ask her. There are a bunch of connectivity features for home automation I have not even been able to touch, yet...I use it for free music streaming by telling her to play a certain genre of music. It's fun to have around! Lots of commands to try out... :)",positive
5657,5.0,"What can I say, this is a great device that makes many home tasks easier and more fun!.",positive
5658,5.0,Get one!! She gets smarter every day.. I've had echo for a few months and love it,positive

5660,4.0,Purchased this as a gift. Waiting for the owner to advise.,positive
5661,2.0,"I was hoping for a 'google' experience, but it isn't there yet. There is a lot of questions that it can't answer. I hope, and expect it to get better. The music player is a nice feature that I use frequently.",negative
5662,4.0,"This item is very helpful, it is useful for all ages and I use it everyday.",positive
5663,5.0,Echo is great for quick question and very entertaining for my son he is always coming up with questions for Alexa. The last thing I do before walking out the door every day is ; Alexa what is the weather and traffic today? Technology today gotta love it.,positive
5664,5.0,Alexa is great. We use it all the time and it loaded with information from traffic to weather to store locations hours etc. The more you use her the more she does,positive
5665,5.0,Siri is great but Alexa takes hints up a notch. I have gotten Philips Hue bulbs and love that I can control lights throughout my house by just asking Alexa to manage them.,positive
5666,5.0,"Hooked up my tv, speakers, lights and cameras to Alexa!",positive
5667,5.0,With amazon prime I was able to create a huge play list. My Echo also turns on lights in some of the most inconvenient areas. Alexa keeps me informed on news weather and sports.,positive
5668,5.0,Fascinating device. Voice recognition is best yet. No irritating wise guy responses like Siri. Integrates spectacularly with Spotify Premium. Can't wait to get my back ordered Echo Dot for my sound system.,positive
5669,5.0,Alexa does a great job playing music and adding items to my shopping list. I have not used very many of the skills but I think this item has great potential to continue to improve.,positive

5674,5.0,Best thing to happen to my life !!! And got it cheaper being in the Best Buy program.,positive
5675,5.0,"One of my best purchases, way better than Siri on an iPhone.",positive
5676,5.0,I love my Amazon echo. Amazon is always updating the software so Alexa is always learning new things that can be useful on a daily basis.,positive
5677,5.0,"I absolutely love Alexa (the wake-up name for the Echo). She tells me a funny fact every morning after I say ""Alexa, good morning"" then I tell her to play my favorite wake-up song(Good Morning Starshine) followed by the local weather and morning news. I get free music all day long from Amazon Prime and I can always hear a Chuck Norris joke. The sound quality is amazing, comparable to a Bose system and it was perfect for our last party. I get updates all the time for new stuff Alexa can do. I love my Echo and find it endlessly fascinating!",positive
5678,5.0,"I was in need of a new small speaker for music in the kitchen. The Echo has been a surprisingly awesome addition to my home. You know that best friend in college you listened to music with who had the most extensive selection of bootleg cassette tapes you had ever seen? With my prime account through Amazon, I have spent countless hours playing music long forgotten. ""Amazon, play {insert artist here}..."" and I am reconnected to old music and exposed to new. I love asking Amazon about the weather while making my coffee. The sound quality is fantastic. There is so much that the Echo can do that I have yet to explore. I started using the grocery list this morning and feel like there is more and more to get out of my Echo. I will be buying an Echo for my folks soon- and my teenagers love it. 5 stars!",positive
5679,5.0,"Talk to Echo to tun on my lights, and set timers all the time",positive
5680,4.0,"This things great! I have it control, lights, my alarm system, & my thermostat. It integrates with IFTTT like a dream as well. The only drawback is having to remember all of the command phrases verbatim. Sound quality is pretty decent unless you turn it out real loud....",positive
5681,5.0,"First of ALL is Alexa understand me well especially with my diction accent not like Siri, Google, Cortana and other. They are all confused due to my accent but not Alexa. It answers all of my questions and inquiry in anything. Actually we now have 2 of this Amazon Echo, Home and Work.",positive
5682,5.0,"Everyone love asking Alexa questions. She has earned her place in the middle of the livingroom now. She listens to your commands, plays songs, reads books, and even controls electronic equipments around the house for you. I sometimes wish Alexa could be portable to follow me everywhere. ;)",positive
5683,5.0,"I'll admit it -- I'm kinda lazy. But this thing is so much fun AND feeds my laziness! Easy set up, does all SORTS of fun things....My favorite is being able to wake up in the middle of the night and say ""Alexa, add orange juice to my shopping list"" and go right back to sleep.",positive
5684,4.0,This device is incredible. It can pick up on your voice from across the room and has yet to make a mistake about what I asked.,positive
5685,5.0,"I was skeptical about the uses for the Amazon Echo and of Alexa but after using it for several weeks, I enjoy the ease of interaction and the accuracy of Alexa. The sound quality from the speaker is very good and I often use the Echo as my go-to audio device when I'm needing some background music for reading, cooking, cleaning, etc.",positive
5686,4.0,So far so good. Works well. Only been using for about two weekswith no problems,positive
5687,5.0,"It's a great technology device and the voice recognition system works great! I can control my house thermostat and yard sprinkler system from the Echo. Echo can also be setup to control the lighting in the house as well. Echo also provides some entertainment for the kids when they ask her random questions and receive comical answers. I have to say it's really nice to just read my shopping list to Echo and have it on my phone for when I go to the grocery store. I've also done away with my alarm clock in my bedroom and use the echo as my alarm clock and weather station. If it's searchable on the Internet, Echo can usually answer your questions. Even though it still needs some fine tuning it's still a wonderful new piece of technology.",positive
5688,4.0,"Alexa works better than expected. Recognizes commands but wish it would make an audible nosise whether or not it is able to perform a function. Sometimes it just dead silence. The app can use more features like more favorites mappable locations than just to ""work"". Overall, not bad for being its first model.",positive
5689,4.0,"it can answer very easy questions, but anything more advanced it does not understand. You have to be very specific, for example you can ask whats in a martini, but you cant ask how do I make a martini. Its got room for improvement.",positive
5690,5.0,"Amazon did it on this one. I love my Echo, from checking the weather to asking random questions. I plugged mine up at the store and played with it for 30 mins with other customers and employees. This thing is a must.",positive
5691,5.0,"I bought the echo after I used it at a friends house, we have a large family so the echo gets used alot and moved around alot, its a huge favorite of everyones",positive
5692,3.0,If it understands your question it works quite well. I enjoy it for music and basic knowledge.,negative
5693,5.0,The Amazon Echo is a very nice addition. It's kind of like Siri without the need to hold a phone. I have it paired with my WeMo switches and so far it works great!,positive
5694,5.0,This is an awesome device. It does everything advertised and then more! Weekly updates on new features are great to receive. No complaints.,positive
5695,5.0,"This is a great addition to any technological home. We don't use it all the time but we use it daily. It has a hard time recognizing my location when we ask for the weather, but we can ask for our city weather and we get it. We use the note taking quiet frequently for calling out what we need for groceries. It plays music that we ask. Now we must get some of the switches and plugs for controlling your lights and home automation. That will be a while, but it is still cool to know it is there as an option. Overall this is a cool toy for the whole family.",positive
5696,4.0,"Wish it could do more without subscribing to Amazion Prime. Bought this for my 19 year old daughter. She likes it a lot, but I think it could be improved by not tying it to a monthly subscription service.",positive
5697,5.0,Just as expected...The Amazon Echo performs great and is an excellent product to add on to a connected home.,positive
5698,5.0,"Very cool product. Easy setup and very easy to use. Setup was fast, especially if you already have a Amazon account.",positive
5699,5.0,The Amazon Echo is a fantastic assistant and helps organize my busy day.,positive
5700,4.0,"I was intrigued by this device and wanted to give it a try. I also have the Bose sound link mini and have to say the sound quality for music is better on the Bose if music is the sole reason for your purchase. For information and requesting a quick song or radio station, this thing rocks. You have to take time letting Alexa learn your voice but overall, the voice recognition is much better than Siri. My one complaint is that it doesn't sync with my Apple Calendar. Come on Amazon, cut a deal with Apple! Anyway, I give this a thumbs up and a 4 star rating. Get one. You won't have buyer's remorse.",positive
5701,5.0,"I got this to use as basically a speaker, but it does so much more! I use her all the time for setting timers, making shopping lists, turning off and on lights. We are adding more items to it slowly. We are adding more lights, the garage door opener, thermostats. So far she has been just great. My kids even enjoy asking her to tell jokes. I would recommend this to everyone. We love it!",positive
5702,5.0,"Every day Alexa learns new skills. She sets the temperature on my Nest, waters my lawn, times my cooking, keeps my shopping list, etc. The only problem I have had is when I listen to Jeopardy and a woman contestant answers with ""WHO IS ..."" Alexa answers.",positive
5703,4.0,Lots of fun to use with other smart home devices.love it,positive
5704,2.0,My hubby bought this for me since I was constantly googling questions on my phone. I was so excited to start asking it questions..... the only problem is Alexa doesn't have any of the answers. Music sounds great on it but that's about it. Not impressed. Save your money.,negative
5705,5.0,"Bought this as a present for our son, turns out to be a great present for the family. Very easy to use and as advertised.",positive
5706,5.0,Love the personal assistant function and listening to music and audio books.,positive
5707,5.0,Wife and kids love this product. I think it has become our personal weathergirl.,positive
5708,4.0,"The Echo is a gateway drug. First, I just wanted a Bluetooth speaker with some novelty features. Then I got smart outlets. Then Hue lights. Now I'm looking at smart locks. Beware ...",positive
5709,5.0,"This piece of tech. is amazing and functional. I liked it so much specially in the morning to check weather, news and listen to some music. High qulaity and solid.",positive
5710,2.0,I am not impressed at all I think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead. This is a expensive item and doesn't do enough for the money you spent. The weather timers adding things to your calendar that's just not enough half the things you ask her she said she doesn't understand,negative
5711,4.0,The Amazon Echo is worth purchasing. I wish it could access a wider variety of music and information.,positive
5712,3.0,Had to spend 2 hours on line to make it work on line.,negative
5713,5.0,Love how it just makes our day even simpler. It's like Google for the home. Best addition of the year. I highly recommend.,positive
5714,4.0,Alexa makes this worth it. AI is intelligent and does get smarter as you talk to it. She has some jokes too. This works even better with a Prime membership. I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't fond of the tube. I can see myself knocking it down. The sound wasn't full or rich enough for me compared to Bose.,positive
5715,5.0,I got it because it is very helpful. Just by calling her name and on top of that ANYTHING you ask her she has the answer. It's like always having someone to talk to. I love my Amazon Echo!,positive
5716,4.0,Very good product. Very useful in mamy scenarios..,positive
5717,5.0,"We have so much fun using the echo almost everyday. We don't give command to echo, we talk to her (yes, echo is not an IT).",positive
5718,5.0,"This product does too many things to even list. I enjoy listening to music, getting weather and traffic reports and just getting silly jokes. I also like that here are weekly email updates about he product.",positive
5719,4.0,Love Echo for streaming music and trivia and weather reports. Very entertaining,positive
5720,4.0,"Wish, it recognize other languages other than English and has a Kid's mode.",positive
5721,5.0,"It literally speaks for it self!!! It's awesome to have something update me on news and entertainment! And the fact that it uses spotify for music as well, that's to awesome. I got it on my Birthday and told Alexa ( the echo's name) it was, and she said, "" happy Birthday"". That's Show's how personal it can get, then the other voice active products. The speaker works almost to well! I live in a 2 story town house, and the voice command can work as I'm walking down stairs. Just check the product out for yourself. You will want one!",positive
5722,5.0,The sound is amazing -- we mostly play music but also use it to answer questions for fun. I just wish it was wireless. I bought a 2nd one since I loved it so much!,positive
5723,5.0,I cannot wait to link my house to this device. I'm only using the factory settings and am thoroughly impressed.,positive
5724,5.0,"I heard about the Echo but thought it was another electronic gimmick I really didn't need (hard for an e-junkie to say no). My brother visited a few weeks ago and convinced me it was worth it so we found one at the local Best Buy and bought it. It's odd how many times we walk by now and ask questions. Growing up decades before the internet, I wonder how dangerous I would have been using it when I was younger. Ah well.",positive
5725,5.0,Love my Amazon echo! Everything exactly as advertised,positive
5726,4.0,I love the voice command and online resources !!!!,positive
5727,5.0,The Echo is amazing. I am able to control the smart home devices from a number of different platforms. Also having the timer and alarms functions makes sure I am able to keep on schedule if needed.,positive
5728,5.0,"Ha my anticipated my purchase having to wait to purchase it, I read a great deal and it did not disappoint. I love my Echo!",positive
5729,4.0,"Neat device, plays music with decent audio and allows me to control my WeMo devices.",positive
5730,5.0,Just plug in and go. Very easy to use right out of the box. Speaker seems to be great quality.,positive
5731,5.0,"I'm a techie. I love cool products.The Echo is a wonderful addition to the home automation revolution.Besides the home automation benefits, the sound quality is superb for the size. I love being able to play music, change the volume, and get updates all via voice. I would like to see some additional updates to how you can interact (without having to say Amazon or Alexa to trigger).Recommend it highly!!!",positive
5732,4.0,I love the echo!!! It like you having a conversation with someone.,positive
5733,4.0,"It's fun being able to ask Alexi questions. There is a lot she can do, but it takes time to figure it out unless you are tech savvy.",positive
5734,3.0,"I am an Amazon fanboy. I'll say it right up front. This device, although nice, currently has limited functions, especially considering the $200 price tag. So until more useful functions (linking to Google Now for instance) are added, I can only give my Echo as much as it pains me to do so, an average rating. Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category.",negative
5735,5.0,Great voice recognition - super easy to set up - the closest you'll get to the computer on the Enterprise!,positive
5736,5.0,"Hands free operation at it's best. I have my Philips Hue hooked up to it (operating my kitchen and family room lights) as well as Pandora, iHeartRadio and my Nest. I have been using it for the past two weeks and I love it. The only issue I have experienced so far has been when I asked Alexa to turn on my family room lights, only one of the two bulbs turned on. This however, might be an issue with the Philips Hue hub. Other than that this has worked out great.",positive
5737,4.0,"I purchased the Amazon Echo to augment my other smart devices. Boy, has it made me lazy. Gone are the days when I'd have to stretch my arm out ALLLLLL the way to the lamp on my nightstand to turn it off. The days of pulling out my smart phone and setting my alarm for the next morning are also gone. Now, a simple ""Alexa, turn off my nightstand"" and ""Alexa, set my alarm for 8:30am"" is all I need. Even walking through my living room, I find myself saying ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights"" and ""Alexa, play my favorites playlist."" You see, it's addicting, and having a wireless speaker that plays music AND controls your life with simple voice commands means you end up buying two. I started with one in my living room but found that I had to yell to turn off said nightstand lamp or turn the thermostat down.... so I bought another. I have now repositioned the one in my living room so that it can hear me when I walk in from the garage, and added the one in my bedroom, which can hear me from the entry or my bathroom.Now, if only she could automate the rest of my life. Amazon is working on it though - I receive weekly emails about new things you can do with Echo.",positive
5738,5.0,As a speaker it just does the job where it excells is as a home automation controolled,positive
5739,5.0,"Alexa is great to use; her recognition is good, and if you have Spotify and Pandora accounts you can really get a lot out of it (and light / outlet kits: saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room"" feels exquisitely dorky). Plus, it's the only way to order the Dot, which is essentially the top of this speaker. After a week with the Echo, I purchased 2 Dots for other rooms. Again, to get the most out of this, you need to own Kindle Books, have a Spotify account, and preferably Audible / Unlimited.",positive
5740,5.0,I never knew our family would enjoy the Echo so much! My wife wanted one bad and Mother's Day was quickly approaching. At first I thought it was expensive and redundant to the technology we already have in our home. Boy was I wrong!! I would highly recommend it to anyone. It's now a member of our family!! Haha,positive
5741,5.0,Ordered multiple products. Both are great. One I have purchased before.,positive
5742,5.0,Full of knowledge and easy to hook up. Would reccomend,positive
5743,5.0,Great item to have in your home. Works exactly as advertised. Hopefully it won't become outdated,positive
5744,4.0,"Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers and voice recognition. I can be 30 plus feet away and communicate with the Echo.2. Speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated. I compare it with the UEBoom device.3. The Amazon Echo App is very easy to manage and add in different functions to access. So many different programed commands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin.4. The design of the unit is very nice. Solid from top to bottom. Quick summary of pros:If you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather, playlists, talk radio, and reading of non-audio books back to you. You will love this unit. I was not a believer prior to purchasing the device. Alexa is much more then just a novelty. Cons:1. The amazon Echo is stationary. If you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place. So if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension cord or an outdoor plug.2. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime then half of the units greatest options are nonexistent. With Amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the Amazon music store. Also, if you have books you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those books on the Echo and have them played back to you. You can use Spotify as a secondary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlists.3. The voice commands are clumsy. What I mean by this is; you have to ask the question exactly like it says in the echo app. Some examples are, ""Alexa, What is the weather like in Manchester England?"", ""Alexa, ask PGA tour for the round leader."", or ""Alexa play the best of the 90's play list from Amazon Music?"". If you miss the ask blank. She will come back with I don't understand the question. Cons summary:These may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the commands exactly will limit the Echo's capacity. The unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic questions. Overall;If you have or plan to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moments. My family does and the Echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime, to finding out the weather, to seeing if our commute to work has any traffic to worry about. If 179.99 is not a lot of money to you for a more hands free toy. Then this is the unit for you.I hope this helps.",positive

5748,5.0,I have wanted Echo ever since it came out. I ordered it off of amazon and they kept saying it was on the wait list. Walked into Best Buy and it was on the shelve in the store. Grabbed one and it was worth the wait. When I got home called Amazon and cancelled my order.,positive
5749,5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves Alexa and speaks to her daily. Can't imagine how he survived without the Flash Briefing or Sports update. The Echo speaker is not as good as our Sonos, but it is great to get the weather or set a timer without touching a device.",positive

5751,5.0,"The Echo has become an integral part of our lives. From turning lights on/off to playing music, getting news briefs or sports score and asking it questions whether important or silly, Echo lives up to its expectations. If you are in to home automation it is a good solid start. Amazon adds new Skills by the day that you can enable from the free Alexa app. Once you buy an Echo you will want another another or 2 more. Skynet is here, Embrace it.",positive

5755,5.0,"This is my second Echo. The first one I purchased at Home Depot for 139. I knocked it off my nightstand a few times with no damage. The last time it fell, it completely died. So now it's just after Christmas and they are few and far between to purchase one. Amazon has a back order for almost a month for 179 and eBay tries to rape you with prices up to 300. I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused. That is all.",positive

5760,5.0,"The Amazon Echo works well. So well, in fact, that I haven't felt the need to use the remote very often. However, there are a few occasions when it is great: 1) When listening to music, getting the volume just right using voice commands can get annoying. The remote is quick, easy, and allows greater fine-tuning. 2) When there is a lot of background noise. The Echo is good, but sometimes has difficulty hearing correctly when I have my kitchen fan on or there is a lot of other background noise. Speaking into the remote never fails (and also doesn't require you to say the wake word). 3) When in another room. I often listen to music on my Echo, even when in another room. Yelling across the house is disturbing, and doesn't always work, but the remote allows me to skip, pause, or turn off the music from my office or bedroom. It's also great for adding items to the shopping and to-do lists.If I lost my remote or, more likely, dropped it in the kitchen sink, I'd buy another without hesitation.",positive
5761,4.0,"Or at least a future I'd like to be living in :-)Lets get this straight. As a Prime member, you can get this for 99. At that rate, think of it as:- A wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instructions to!- An alarm clock that you can shout at (Alexa! Shut up!) in the morning, and it will obey you :) (its my half asleep morning power trip)- Set a timer for when you're cooking- Fact check your friend while you argue with them :PSo my common use cases aside, here's what is good about Echo:- Speech recognition works *really* well, esp for brief phrases.- It can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room, and is pretty accurate with the wake word (I've been using Alexa)- As a music player, its really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just come up, without having to hunt through a playlist, connect to the bluetooth speaker etc.- Purchasing music is pretty seamless. (As if Amazon needed another way to get you to spend money:-) )- iHeart radio integration, if you're into that kinda thingHere is what is not so great:- Speech recognition for longer phrases needs a couple of attempts, maybe because of my accent. (e.g. Alexa, play the song The Troubles by U2- As a music player, its a bit lacking in bass.- Sometimes, while its playing music, you have to use the wake word once or twice to gets its attention- Bing search Really *rolls eyes*I'd love to see in the future:- Integration with Fire TV, so that I can simply say Alexa, play The Sopranos on my TV- Google search- Being able to send a message to a friend in my contacts Alexa, message XYZ blah blah blahOverall, its a pretty cool product, and I'd love to see what it looks like over time!",positive
5762,5.0,"When I originally wrote this review this remote shipped with the Amazon Echo. Since that time Amazon has made it a separate purchase and dropped the retail price of the Echo by twenty bucks. I purchased my Echo via the Prime invitation for ninety-nine dollars, and at that time it came with this remote, but as stated - it's now only sold as a separate accessory and DOES NOT ship with the current Amazon Echo offered for sale on Amazon for one seventy-nine at the time of this review revision (12/6/15).-----------------------------------This is an excellent accessory for Amazon Echo owners, but please note you cannot pair more than 1 Amazon Echo remote with the Echo at one time.The remote comes with a magnetic cradle which is very handy for storage. (I have my Amazon Echo in my home office, and I store my remote on the magnetic holder which is attached to the side of a wire shelving unit. The remote will not just magnetically attach to metal devices without the holder however.------------------------------------------------What I have found is that using the remote becomes necessary in these scenarios:1. I'm in another room and I want to direct the Amazon Echo to change music or adjust the volume of music that's playing. (Change album, forward to the next song, have the Echo start playing another Amazon playlist from Prime Music, etc...).2. I want to add something to my Shopping List or To Do list when I'm in another room. I pick up the remote and speak into it, having Alexa add those things which then become visible on my list on my smatphone using the Amazon Echo app.3. I want to know the weather before getting out of bed, but the Amazon Echo is in the other room and wouldn't be able to hear me ask.Read more",positive
5763,5.0,"This is a review for the echo itself since you can't leave a review for it yet. I received my echo March 24, 2015 and i love it! I requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of December 2014. I got an email from Amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in January. I am a prime member so I purchased it for 99 right after I got that email. It said it would be shipped out around the first week of April. However in March I received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did. So I waited 3 months from the time I requested it. I'm so glad I bought it back then because the price for prime members is now 149. Anyways I personally love the Echo. My 3 daughters love it more then I do. I have a 9, 6, and a 2.5 yr old and they all kno how to use it. My little one tries to say Alexa play Mimi (Minnie mouse) so she can hear the Mickey mouse clubhouse theme song. I primarily got this for my daughters. One of them is dyslexic and the other 2 are on the spectrum. So they need help with doing homework. Alexa comes in so handy for this especially with spelling. My dyslexic daughter mixes up letters so this feature helps her tremendously. Also being able to voice command Alexa to play a song at any time, really comes in handy when I'm trying to redirect my daughters, when they are having a melt down. My youngest is obsessed with Mickey so if I say Alexa play hot dog, my 2 yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music. So for these features make me happy! Also the music plays very clear and loud in my opinion. I didn't have any problems with the app until today. It did seem off today. However they are always updating things so I don't know if that's what caused it to be different.Read more",positive
5764,5.0,"I had ordered the Echo and from what I had read I did not think I would need the Remote. The Echo works great if you are in the same Room. I like to listen to Music while I am cooking, cleaning, or doing nothing. I always had to go back in the same room to where my Echo was to change or skip to the next Song if I wanted. With the Remote I can change it from any room. I just stick it in my Pocket and take it out when I want to switch, turn it down or up. Connects through Blue Tooth very quickly. Has a magnetic holder to keep the Remote on (mine is on my Desk Leg) to keep it when not in use. There is a Felt Pad on the back of the Magnetic Holder so that it will not scratch any surface that it is attached to. I love it!",positive

5766,5.0,Having been anticipating this purchase for a while my research was obsessive and not in the slightest bit was my expectations not met. It's been a extension that permits info more rapidly than before with not the need for a screen to see it. Still not lose to explored its limits that expand quicker than I could map figuratively. Love my Alexa!!,positive
5767,4.0,"Saw quite a few youtube videos on this product and thought it would be fun to have. We have it downstairs in a split level house and keep it downstairs.

5773,5.0,"This is my second Echo. If you are NOT into home automation, the speaker is worth the price just as a speaker. However, if you have an amazon Prime membership, the Echo really shines with access to prime music and other Amazon services. It is also a good way to start into home automation. I personally have the wink Hub and Relays; Alexa (Echo´s Siri) integrates perfectly with Wink and IFTTT. I am placing Echos in rooms where I want Wireless music and the dots in the rest of the rooms to control my Smart devices from anywhere in the house.",positive

5775,5.0,"Alexa really works. I was sceptical at first, now she is part of the family. I'm cooking , I have three different things on the go, microwave, stovetop, and outside on the grill; all need to be pulled off the heat at different times. No problem , I just ask Alexa to set timers for each item as I go along, awesome! Time to watch a movie now , "" Alexa turn off living room lights "" The lights dim and she confirms with ""OK "" - nice. A little bit too warm, "" Alexa, set temperature to 69° "" The air-conditioner comes on ,magical . My nephew does not like what we are cooking, "" Alexa open Domino's "" she asks for my order choice, within seconds Dominos has the order, paid for , arrives on time . This is truly one of the coolest devices I have ever purchased . I almost forgot, anytime I want to hear a piece of music that I loved from my past I just call it out and she can pull it up right there and then I can listen to it, in near Bose quality sound , Magic!!!!",positive
5776,5.0,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the ‘Helpful’ button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!",positive

5778,5.0,My Alexa is so awesome. While cleaning the house it's so easy just to say Alexa play… Without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which songs you want. My housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable.,positive

He is very pleased with the quality of the sound, as am I.Even though we use the Amazon Echo for mostly playing music, telling the forecast and adding items to our shopping list, to be perfectly honest, I’d love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and I hate having to unplug and move her.",positive

5792,5.0,"I have more fun with this thing… I'm much more likely to play music or check the temperature or news, because Alexia is constantly attached to my network and is always charged and ready to go.

5796,5.0,"I've had my eye on the Echo for a few months now. I didn't realize Best Buy had got them in stock until I was discussing with the sales person. I decided to give it a try. Set up was so easy. The voice recognition has been excellent. Alexa hears and appropriately responds to all of my requests, as well as my husband's. It really comes in handy in the mornings, as I can request news and entertainment while getting ready for the day. I can review my daily schedule, adjust it, make lists and so much more. Integration with IFTTT works great. The amount of easily available content is wonderful. While I don't have any smart devices such as lights or thermostats yet, I am planning for them, and will be able to use the Echo to control them.",positive
5797,5.0,"Lights, timers, grocery's, Alexa, Echo's voice service does it all and more. Voice recognition is amazing, from across the room, when music is playing it works. Built in speakers are very good (on a Bluetooth speaker level). Setup is easy with the free App. select what ""skills"" you want to activate to customize Echo to your home, (skills are Alexa's ability's). More and more integration into home automation weekly, Alexa already controls select lights, switches, thermostats, even integration with some cars (start car remotely, how many miles remain before refueling). What could be easier then using voice commands that work and simply asking questions to get information?",positive
5798,4.0,I bought this for myself and I am enjoying it. I like all of the information I can get. I also like that it can play music that I picked out and give me interesting facts for the day.

Shopping on Amazon is really easy and fun as well. There's a whole bunch of apps so it won't be hard for you to find what will make the Echo useful to you specifically. We love it. I couldn't recommend it more.",positive
5801,2.0,"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!",negative

5805,4.0,"I thought it would be a hassle to set up. It was easy. I thought it might feel creepy. I like her. I got it primarily for music. Know that if you purchase Amazon's Unlimited Music via Alexa, it's first month free, then 3.99 thereafter. You don't get that deal online. And you don't have to be a Prime member, which I find too expensive. I'm also thrilled that I can get my Pandora stations, which I think is not the case with Google's version. There are some things she doesn't understand but sometimes rewording helps. Several interesting skills to call upon. Fun. I like it.",positive

5860,5.0,It seems to work just like any other usb plug in charger.,positive
5861,4.0,"As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last. Ive never had one break as other brands do, I just keep leaving them in random hotels and airports while traveling and have to buy another! If you are looking for a solid and longer-lasting charger for your tablet, I would recommend this one.",positive

If I use the charger that came with my Kindle for the same amount of time I don't see the Low Battery message as quickly as I did with this charger. Not sure what's going on but makes me think I have a faulty device -- costs a lot of money for something that doesn't work any longer than 1 month,negative

5870,1.0,"This thing is garbage! Do not buy! It is the slowest charger I've every had. It is NOT a fast charger. It is a disgrace that Amazon is offering this product as a fast charger, and discontinued the previous all black square, blocky fast charger which really was a fast charger. This thing is NOT a fast charger. Save your money. Amazon needs to seriously check their supplier, the manufacturer of this junk.Advertising this thing as a fast charger is totally deceptive.",negative
5871,5.0,"This fast charger gets my Kindle HD up to 100 in about two hours much, much faster than the regular 5W charger.-It doesnt hog two outlets when you plug it in.

You can use any Kindle micro-to-USB cable of any length. I use the economical AmazonBasics Micro-USB to USB Cable - 6 Feet with no problem.-It charges my Kindle HD from 25 to 100 in about two hours.My only quibble about it is that the two power prongs dont fold into the body of the charger for storage as they did with the old version. But thats just a quibble.",positive

I tried using it on my 1st Gen Fire but I think I may have damaged it since it was on its last legs anyway.I checked it works on my Paperwhite.,positive
5877,5.0,"I had to buy myself another of these 9W chargers because so many other USB chargers are relatively useless. I have chargers that won't even put out enough power to use the device while it is charging, and in fact, some devices discharge completely if you leave them on while they are charging.The 9W charger does a great job, and eventually, I might have a 9W charger both at my desk and near my bed.I highly recommend this product.",positive

It does wake the Fire up when opened (and shut down when closed) but that has never been important to me. My problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward. I'd like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject.",negative

Waste of money. I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all. I'll feel bad telling them, and they'll feel bad hearing it. Bad all around.",negative

5890,2.0,"Not the best case Amazon has ever put out! I have a number of other Amazon brand Kindle and Kindle Fire cases for my various Kindle devices and this is the least effective of the bunch. It doesn't stand in any position, so I can't use my 6 hands free. It also doesn't line up properly when closed, so the Fire seems to come out of sleep mode, thus draining the battery more quickly. And finally, I have discovered that I do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from. I understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the Kindle Fire HD 6...not that this case was any bargain at 30!!",negative

5896,4.0,"These days, Amazon doesn't supply a charger when you purchase a new Kindle. That makes sense because most Kindle purchasers probably have older Kindle models already, or other USB powered devices or phones or tablets, many of which will have included chargers. As a result most people will already have a sufficient supply of chargers sitting around.But for someone who wants or needs a new charger when they order a new Kindle, Amazon presents you with the option to buy one at the time of your Kindle purchase.So I was surprised when I noticed this new charger model now being offered as an option for new Kindles. My first thought was that Amazon had updated their previous charger models to bring them up-to-date and make them competitive with the great variety of third party chargers now available (see links below for these earlier models).As soon as I looked at the specs for this charger though, I was disappointed. Unfortunately, even though this is Amazon's latest basic charger offering, it is not in my opinion the best choice for someone who needs a USB charger, for a Kindle or for anything else for that matter. And that's something I wouldn't usually find myself saying, because usually Amazon's accessories are reasonably priced and competitive.This is certainly a capable and functional charger, and it will work perfectly fine with any Kindle device and charge it acceptably well. But here are the reasons why I feel this is not the best choice:- It will supply only 1 A output, maximum. That's sufficient for a Kindle e-reader but not sufficient for many other devices. Any of the Fire devices, for example, will benefit from a higher output charger in order to reduce charging time.Read more",positive

You can safely use up to 5.25 watts and anything between .5 and 1 amp (500mA-1000mA).If you don't have an extra cell phone charger lying around just buy a well reviewed power adapter with the above specifications that connects to your Kindle (micro USB). They can be found for under 10 locally or through Amazon.",negative
5902,3.0,"I would like to rate this 3 and half stars - while the adapter itself works just fine, I think it is underhanded of Amazon to make you pay extra for it. Maybe I am not technologically up-to-date, but it seems to me that most people charge things at a wall socket not with a computer USB port. I think that I read that charging with USB takes longer as well. Just like an airline charging you for taking your bags on the plane, now Amazon is charging you for things you need to make the Kindle work - pretty soon you'll have to pay for the cord, guides and updates. Not very good customer service :(",negative
5903,2.0,"I dont own this, first off. But 1 amp wont charge anything very quickly, and I only write this review because they advertised it on my Fire. The price is 19.99 as of this advert, and thats way out of line for a 1 amp charger.",negative
5904,4.0,"Works great as I would expect it too. Only complaint, why is this not just part of the kindle purchase instead of a separate line item.",positive
5905,4.0,Item arrived within estimated delivery date. Package received in good condition. Product performs as advertised in its description.I feel it is a must for kindle owners or any e-reader for that matter. I find myself reading in areas far out of reach of my computer so having an outlet charger becomes a necessity. I would recommend it to any kindle owner.,positive
5906,5.0,What can one say. It charges my Kindle.,positive
5907,5.0,"A nice update to the original 5W USB Power Adapter. Despite how wonderful the 9W USB Power Adapter is for Kindle Fires, I still actually prefer to use this oldie but goodie due to the way the 9W folds. I actually prefer not to have the pointy bits (lack of a better term) fold away as this causes problems when trying to connect it to something new. I actually prefer this to charging my Kindle Fire faster as the 5W is really for the regular E Ink Kindles like my Kindle Voyager.Now the 9W is fine for traveling and if you leave the charger plugged in. But this new sleek and black and white charger works and turns heads with a white or black cord depending on if you still have those old white cords laying about.",positive
5908,5.0,"Love it ! I started with a kindle,then a fire kindle, and now a fire tablet. I can do everything from reading, listening to music, watching movies to surfing the internet. Well worth the money.",positive
5909,4.0,Grandchild loves the tablet. Easy to set up and child and adult user griendly,positive
5910,3.0,"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.",negative
5911,4.0,Picture quality is very clear good size to take with me.I wished i would found a cover for this model at the store. Universal model does not work as to I have to take cover off to use camera,positive
5912,4.0,Great Tablet.Performs very well so far.Pictures and graphics are of very good quality.,positive
5913,4.0,Very good but does not take all aps unless it is related to Amazon. I could not get all the aps I wanted. Good tablet for reading.,positive

5915,5.0,i really love this product i have down loaded many many books and i like it because it is big when i brought mine my sister returned and purchased her one too,positive
5916,5.0,Very nice people and good product. I would buy from again.,positive
5917,4.0,"I read the camera specs which is what caught my eye and they are great - takes great picture but the ""zoom"" feature quickly distorts actual picture.",positive
5918,5.0,"I can do everything I need on this tablet while traveling - check my email, browse the internet with the silk browser app, youtube, free app games etc. Because I have an amazon prime account as well, I linked my tablet to it so I can access a huge variety of free music, tv and movies. There are several offline options to load files onto the SD card, or to your tablets memory, so you can watch movies or use it as a mp3 player while away from internet. I watched a 2 hour movie on the airplane and only went through 30% of the battery power. Beautiful screen, loud speakers with the option for headphones. I have no reason to want anything more expensive, such as an ipad or surface since this does all I need while away from home.",positive
5919,1.0,"I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",negative
5920,5.0,Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase,positive
5921,5.0,Bought 3 for different and after 3 years mine went kerplot gona get new upgraded one for Christmas this year,positive

5925,5.0,"Easy to setup, easy to use. I've had another tablet, but it wasn't as easy and comfortable to use. For what I bought it for, it's perfect for me. It weighs less than a pound (compared to my other tablet), and I can read what's on the screen easier. Without a manual, the best thing you can do is play with it. I'm still learning this and expect to get rolling on it very soon.",positive
5926,5.0,use it everyday. enjoy reading using the Kindle Fire HD 10.,positive
5927,5.0,Easy to set up. Good size tablet. Like the addition of Alexa,positive

5933,4.0,"I love the kindle. I'm not completely happy with the sound quality of the speaker's. And, a month later it already seems to be lagging and freezing a bit. I have one music app, several books, and a few games on it. I don't seem to be using it as much as my 7 during long trips just because of the size.",positive
5934,4.0,"The kindle fire 10 is a major upgrade from the original fire. My kids, 8 and 11, referred to it as an IPad when it was first received.",positive

5936,5.0,"This tablet is so much easier to use than my 6"" fire. It is great for reading or eatching movies.",positive
5937,4.0,"I was looking for a larger tablet than my 7"" Kindle Fire and was on the fence that the 10"" Kindle Fire would be too large. Much to my surprise, it has been an easy adjustment. While larger, the video viewing is better and the magazine reading is much easier on the eyes. Although I miss my 7"" for my book reading as the 10"" seems too big, I am happy overall with the new tablet.",positive
5938,4.0,"I like Kindle obviously but I find the 10 inch is bulky, heavier and difficult to handle by someone with carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis. It's easier to see the screen on the 10"" but I prefer the smaller screen because it's better for handling with my arthritic, weak joints/grip. I do have to admit the bigger screen is better for watching videos and movies!",positive
5939,5.0,I love my original Kindle Fire but the size and features on the latest Kindle are a plus,positive

5942,5.0,"We have had several of the Kindles over the years. This was a replacement to an HDX (wish they still made those). The screen is big and very clear and easy to navigate. Kids play alot of games and use it to read books on for school. I would also recommend these to family members, like grandparents. The screen size and ease of use makes for less calls back to the family IT person.",positive
5943,5.0,I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent.,positive
5944,5.0,"I bought this for a family member because they had the smaller 7"" Amazon Fire. The 10"" version can be held easier in my opinion",positive

5952,5.0,"Perfect technology for my 11 year old son for games, reading, and homework.",positive
5953,4.0,This tablet does everything that we need it to do. The screen looks really good and it doesn't seem to be under powered. The expandable storage feature is awesome if you want to store music and movies on it. The only thing that is a negative is the limited selection of apps for it. I knew about it before I bought it and it hasn't been an issue yet.,positive
5954,5.0,"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",positive

5958,4.0,"you might find it somewhat short on available apps. My wife has an Android (Samsung) that is quite deep in app selection. That is not to say you can't find suitable choices. Every machine has it's qwerks and the Kindle starts up when you plug it in to charge. Unnecessary. Overall the 10"" is great viewing, especially for the older eyes.",positive
5959,5.0,This is a wonderful tablet. It's lite weight and super simple to use. I bought one for myself and thinking of getting one for my grandmother.,positive

5961,5.0,The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It's nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well!,positive
5962,4.0,"I bought this tablet for my wife. She likes the size for reading books and for reading info on the web. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. It also has to be charged often, and that's not even considering time reading books. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle.",positive
5963,4.0,"great screen, a little slow at times and screen touch could be better.",positive

5970,4.0,Picked up my fire hd 10 from the store on Saturday. it took most of the day to update the software. You would think that he software would just update to the current software . even that was not a big deal. after that I had some issues with the battery so what I did was bring it back to a factory reset. what that did was keep the software build and battery life was better. I have not had any issues with the appstore and I also sideload apps that aren't available to the amzon appstore. all in all this tablet has been great for me. my other tablet was kindle hd 8.9 and it has service my good for the last 4 yrs,positive

5974,5.0,"My wife owns one, so we bought one for my mom who is not tech-savvy, and she seems to be having great success with it so far.

6003,3.0,This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying.

6021,5.0,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading.

(we bought one for him the same time and he loves his too). I use it for email, games, social media, internet and some accounting. I love it. It's fast, reliable, easy to use, easy to see. It seems durable but for extra protection, I bought a shock case with a flip stand on the back so it can be protected and more versatile. My only wish would be that its battery lasted longer for my constant use...but I suppose everyone needs a break every few (2-4) hours. It does charge back up pretty fast.I think its a great tablet!",positive
6053,5.0,This was bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it very much. She uses it every day and it helps her relax. I am so happy that we found something she enjoys so much.

6060,5.0,"I sometimes find the store a little intimidating, and certainly overwhelming. I don't always know what I want beforehand.

6063,1.0,"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need.",negative

6103,3.0,I recently bought my fourth Kindle. I bought it because it is familiar and while there are improvements the keyboard is still difficult and not accurate.

6107,4.0,This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good.

6110,5.0,makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.,positive

6160,5.0,"I had a tough time finding reviews for this version of the Tamron. Read several reviews comparing the Nikon and the Sigma equivalents to this lens' previous version. The main draw back for the original Tamron 600mm was some design issues like lack of weather proofing. All those seem to be addressed from what I can see and have read. I have not done a high end performance test with color charts dissecting every bit of pixel like some articles I read. I can say that it works very well and the detail I get with my D810 is incredible. I took the below shot at the zoo. The weight can be off putting to some people but that comes with the territory of any large lens and I don't see this one being anything out of the ordinary when it comes to weight. If you are like me and have been eyeing this lens for a while and over researching, do yourself a favor and just go out and get it. You wont be disappointed.",positive

First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",positive

6165,4.0,The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.,positive
6166,3.0,"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well.",negative
6167,4.0,"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.",positive
6168,5.0,"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",positive
6169,5.0,"If you have an Amazon Echo already then you know what a great gadget it is. This is Echo in baby size and portable. The newer version can be ""woken up"" with your voice like its big sister or you can program it to only respond when you push the mike button. It had all the features of Echo and excellent sound for its size. I have it in the bedroom and use it as an alarm and music when I get dressed. All in all a great item for the price.",positive
6170,5.0,"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!",positive
6171,5.0,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.",positive
6172,4.0,"I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use.",positive
6173,5.0,Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.,positive
6174,5.0,"I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day.",positive
6175,5.0,"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more",positive
6176,5.0,Love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music,positive
6177,3.0,I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.,negative
6178,4.0,"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen.",positive
6179,5.0,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,positive
6180,5.0,"Best sounding Amazon speaker hands down. The only annoyance is that it beeps after the ""Alexa"" wake word and after the command, unlike the other echos I have with no obvious way to turn this off. Other than that, sounds great and can take with you pretty well anywhere....",positive

6188,5.0,This product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations.

6189,5.0,Really like the Wi Fi & being able to take it to any room in the house. My music sounds great. Love all the features.,positive
6190,3.0,"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apps better.",negative
6191,5.0,I first boughy alezxa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking,positive

6193,5.0,Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.,positive
6194,5.0,"Overall I was a little skeptical because this wasn't the product I wanted. Turns out, it's amazing!",positive
6195,5.0,"I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!",positive
6196,5.0,"I have the Amazon dot, which is great. But after purchasing the tap, which was on sale too, I was sold. You can take it any where. And the sound is great!!!",positive
6197,5.0,"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!",positive
6198,5.0,This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.,positive
6199,5.0,Great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway.,positive
6200,5.0,"Unlike the larger version, this does not need to be plugged in..making it portable....although you have to press the button for every request..it's great to take with you where ever you go..fully rechargable",positive
6201,5.0,We really love our new Amazon Tap. My Son enjoys playing with it.,positive
6202,4.0,"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time.",positive
6203,4.0,"The Amazon Tap is outstanding. There have been more applications slowly becoming avaliable. It is simple to use. It works with our Nest, which is a nice application.",positive
6204,5.0,"The Tap works great, just like Alexa's little helper.",positive
6205,5.0,We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.,positive
6206,5.0,The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.,positive
6207,5.0,Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun,positive
6208,5.0,Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.,positive
6209,4.0,"It takes me a few tries to figure out how to connect to internet and then change it to blue tooth when needed. Overall , once it's set up it's super easy to use. Works best if you have Spotify premium. Voice recognition is good and it improves over time. Sound quality is good. Battery is really good.",positive
6210,5.0,"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.",positive
6211,5.0,"I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it.",positive
6212,4.0,The Tap is a great companion to your every day business. It has become my partner in my daily communications.,positive
6213,4.0,"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!",positive
6214,5.0,Good price works great would buy again good value for the price,positive
6215,4.0,"I had trouble linking to my Joule Cooking App, finally got on the third day. I Love it now, still is learning Voice Recognition though",positive
6216,5.0,"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!",positive
6217,5.0,"If you dont need the voice activation of Alexa, or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you, consider the Tap. Almost all of the functionality of Alexa, but in a smaller ( and less expensive ) version.Great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives.",positive
6218,5.0,Great sound quality from such a small item. Easy to hide so it's not noticeable.,positive
6219,5.0,"This little speaker is way better that her mother. after that update making it hand free, i recommend to anyone.",positive
6220,4.0,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.,positive
6221,5.0,This portable Bluetooth speaker has an excellent sound which can be taken anywhere unlike the Echo and Echo Dot which both have to be plugged in. Want to listen to a favorite song? Just ask Alexa. Want to know the weather report? Just ask Alexa. Want to know your horoscope? Just ask Alexa. A lot of fun and entertainment at a great price. Big things come in small packages!,positive
6222,5.0,Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.,positive
6223,5.0,The product it amazing love that it turns in lights on and plays my favorite music.,positive
6224,4.0,"I love it hut I think I should have got the bigger one, but its entertaining",positive
6225,5.0,This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!,positive
6226,4.0,"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows",positive
6227,5.0,Incredible range. Clear sound. We bought the sleeve and hung it in the backyard for a party. Amazing 360 clear sound.,positive
6228,5.0,"This is a great device, with Alexa, and the battery makes it really portable. It follows me all over the house, on the deck, in the garage, etc.",positive
6229,5.0,I have the have the Echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home. Especially if I'm working in the garage and want to listen to music,positive
6230,4.0,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.,positive
6231,4.0,"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options",positive
6232,4.0,I like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice. You can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say Alexa.,positive
6233,5.0,"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.",positive
6234,5.0,"I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions. Additional voice features I use are news reports, weather forecasts, and control of WeMo switches in my home. Overall a great buy.",positive
6235,5.0,"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one.",positive
6236,4.0,Took a bit of time but I figured how to get the most out out using Alexa and luv it.,positive
6237,4.0,"Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist.....",positive
6238,5.0,It helps the kids with questions it plays any music you like .,positive
6239,5.0,This Alexa is a super form of info with little wait time.,positive
6240,5.0,"Has great sound, clarity,alexia has great responses",positive
6241,4.0,"I really like my Tap very much. It great when it's connected. Reads me news, weather, plays music and can purchase items from Amazon That being said, I do have some connectivity problems while on wifi. I don't want to say that it's the taps fault as it may be my wifi. I don't regret my purchase. It has great sounds and recognizes my voice commands well.",positive
6242,4.0,We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.,positive
6243,5.0,We use this speaker all the time. It's perfect. I would buy this time and time again.,positive
6244,4.0,I love the Amazon Tap. The sound is great and it's completely portable. It lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate. Excellent product for the money!,positive
6245,1.0,"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear",negative
6246,5.0,Works as well as the Echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it. Battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good. Easy to move around in and out of the house. Will work anywhere you have WIFI. If you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive Echo.,positive
6247,5.0,"Purchased this as a gift for a teenage kid as a graduation present. Very pleased with the purchase. The kids love it. Small size, but good speakers. Perfect for the college dorms where he is scheduled to go in a couple of months. Love how the device connects to the cloud and keeps itself updated.",positive
6248,4.0,I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.,positive
6249,4.0,"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem.",positive
6250,4.0,Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .,positive
6251,5.0,"The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go.",positive
6252,4.0,"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!",positive
6253,5.0,Having fun exploring the capabilities. The sound quality is great!,positive
6254,4.0,"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.",positive
6255,2.0,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.,negative
6256,5.0,"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!",positive
6257,5.0,"The tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size. I also have an Amazon Dot, but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the Tap to enjoy the better sound. It's worth it.",positive
6258,4.0,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",positive
6259,5.0,I Luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to,positive
6260,5.0,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,positive
6261,5.0,"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",positive
6262,3.0,"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it",negative
6263,4.0,"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!",positive
6264,5.0,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.,positive
6265,3.0,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,negative
6266,4.0,I am enjoying the Tap very much. Lot's to do and play with on the app. Still finding new things it can do daily. Great sound quality to play my music. I only wish that it had a better search engine.,positive
6267,3.0,I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.,negative
6268,4.0,"I have the echo, the dot and now the tap. The sound is good. Better than the dot but not as good as the echo. The thing the tap has over the echo and dot is its portability. Which is nice not have to be next to a plug all the time. I would recommend it.",positive
6269,5.0,Didn't want to spend $200 on the Echo for someone who's not use to using a Bluetooth speaker. Great buy and functions well.,positive
6270,3.0,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,negative
6271,5.0,"My family and I are enjoying Alexa. Great for playing music, setting timers, adding to shopping list, etc. Still finding new and useful things to do with it.",positive
6272,5.0,My 8 yr old daughter loves her Tap. She uses it for HW and play. Never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her Tap.,positive
6273,5.0,It is a quality product and has clear crisp sound. Best part it can be carried in any satchel. Sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering.,positive
6274,5.0,"The Tap is a fun way to be able to bring Alexa around your home. Where ever you are, you can get access to all of the information, music, news, radio and more!",positive
6275,4.0,Great sound. Love it. It's value is well worth it.,positive
6276,1.0,We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.,negative
6277,5.0,I purchased this for my son's birthday.. he loved it..,positive
6278,5.0,"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift.",positive
6279,5.0,"This is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa. I use it to stream Spotify, Pandora andESPN Radio. Small speaker fills the Garage like a concert hall. Battery last 8 hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use.",positive
6280,5.0,Love all the features that come with this speaker. Alexa function by tapping device is a nice change of pace from the always listening echo and dot! Above avarage sound on the go and got a great deal on it!,positive
6281,5.0,We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.,positive
6282,4.0,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.,positive
6283,4.0,Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.,positive
6284,5.0,"Great item, good service from Best Buy. It is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often.",positive
6285,4.0,I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing,positive
6286,5.0,"Love the Tap! Bought it as a gift and love the sound quality. For such a small speaker, it packs a big punch!",positive
6287,4.0,"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo.",positive
6288,5.0,I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.,positive
6289,4.0,Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.,positive
6290,5.0,"This device can be a very load speaker, I mean really LOUD. It also can access AMAZON prime service without a computer. I like this little Tap.",positive
6291,5.0,"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.",positive
6292,5.0,It's great just wish it did not need a button to work. Otherwise love it!,positive
6293,5.0,Love the speaker and the assistance of Alexa. Was trying to choose between this and a regular Bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs.,positive
6294,5.0,"I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!",positive
6295,5.0,"Wife loves it! Great sound, great technology! Compact and durable.",positive
6296,5.0,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it.,positive
6297,3.0,I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound,negative
6298,5.0,"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks.",positive
6299,4.0,Good sound quality. Charging dock is an added advantage.,positive
6300,5.0,I'm amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and I recommend it,positive
6301,4.0,I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.,positive
6302,5.0,"Small, portable works as a blue tooth speaker when I take it away from home with me.",positive
6303,5.0,The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,positive
6304,5.0,I have the Echo and bought this one for the bedroom. Great alarm clock.,positive
6305,2.0,"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine.",negative
6306,4.0,Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!,positive
6307,5.0,Camera was perfect for my daughter... she's in yearbook at school and fell in love with it...,positive
6308,5.0,Great for travel. It is very loud for its size. Over all I love it.,positive
6309,3.0,You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.,negative
6310,4.0,I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!,positive
6311,5.0,"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc.",positive
6312,3.0,Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.,negative
6313,4.0,"..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode.",positive
6314,5.0,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.",positive
6315,5.0,Gift for my wife to listen to her music when she's sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out.,positive
6316,4.0,"I really like the sound of the tab. The only complaint is that you have to push the button every time you have to speak or listen to tab. Unlike the echo, where you just speak and it answers without pushing any buttons. The echo has a cheaper sounding speaker. I'd wait till there is a sale in it before paying full price. Otherwise, it is just like a Bluetooth speaker.",positive
6317,3.0,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that',negative
6318,5.0,"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it.",positive
6319,4.0,you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it Plays all my music,positive
6320,5.0,"Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc.",positive
6321,5.0,"great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.",positive
6322,5.0,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",positive
6323,5.0,I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.,positive
6324,5.0,Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.,positive
6325,2.0,The portability is nice but misses key elements from the other two.Sound is good but this unit does not allow for the new peak in feature or allow you to add this speaker to play music all thru the house .,negative
6326,4.0,"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.",positive
6327,4.0,It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.,positive
6328,5.0,Great product for when you are on the go.great sound,positive
6329,5.0,I like it because we move it around the house &I to the garage and pool area.,positive
6330,5.0,"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.",positive
6331,3.0,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,negative
6332,5.0,Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal,positive
6333,5.0,Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.,positive
6334,4.0,I wanted a portable speaker that worked with Amazon prime music. There is nothing in the market right now that does that except for the Tap. For the $100 price its fine. I would rather spend $200 and get a better sound quality speaker though since it will be used outside as well as is in the kitchen.,positive
6335,5.0,I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is,positive
6336,4.0,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.,positive
6337,5.0,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.She loves it, easy to use, speakers are more clear than her other devices Great volume",positive
6338,5.0,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",positive
6339,5.0,"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.",positive
6340,5.0,This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.,positive
6341,5.0,Truly amazing combination of portability and ease of use and good sound.,positive
6342,5.0,Great speaker and Echo substitute. This is great for on the go as a Bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the Alexa app.,positive
6343,5.0,Before I bought this I had a blue tooth speaker and an iPod touch. Both of which had to be charged and turned on etc. now I just tell Alexa to play music.,positive
6344,5.0,"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.",positive
6345,5.0,This is everything the echo is but portable. You're not getting the same sound quality but more than enough for the backyard or beach. A recent update was made to give you the option of using the button or voice activated controls.,positive
6346,5.0,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,positive
6347,5.0,"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously.",positive
6348,5.0,"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot.",positive
6349,5.0,Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.,positive
6350,5.0,"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!",positive
6351,5.0,This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass),positive
6352,5.0,It's a great device to have. It does so many things. Very practical.,positive
6353,5.0,The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.,positive
6354,5.0,Alexa works great. It was easy to set-up and to us. My wife uses it for playing music through her iPhone and is very happy with it. I am always finding and learning new things with Alexa.,positive
6355,4.0,I haven't figured it out yet. So far it seems ok but I haven't used all of its potential yet.,positive
6356,4.0,This gizmo is awesome for those who want the portability and cool things you can do with the Alexa world!,positive
6357,5.0,Fun new product. Great gift idea especially if you aren't good with technology.,positive
6358,5.0,Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the Alexa feature I listen to Kindle books that are not available as audio books,positive
6359,5.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend, he LOVES it! He takes it on every trip we go on. It's so powerful for such a small speaker! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",positive
6360,5.0,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked,positive
6361,5.0,I use this for setting alarms and reminders and for activating my lifX lights. The set up is super easy and sound quality and volume levels are really good too,positive
6362,5.0,We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.,positive
6363,4.0,"I have not had such a reliable speaker before. It is so easy to charge, and so easy to start playing songs right away. With Alexa, you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone, unlocking it, and pulling up Google.com. Love it.",positive
6364,4.0,The only thing we don't like is that it had to stay plugged in to work.,positive
6365,5.0,Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.,positive
6366,5.0,"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do – including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source.",positive
6367,5.0,Love being able to use Alexa unplugged. Amazing device!,positive
6368,5.0,I enjoy that I can use Alexa and take it around with me. Especially being able to listen to music anywhere I want.,positive
6369,4.0,we're early in the stages of home smartness but this is a good start,positive
6370,5.0,I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where,positive
6371,4.0,Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!,positive
6372,5.0,"Great sound, almost perfect interactions and portable. I have the dot and now the tap. The new update allowing voice activation is awesome. Great toy!",positive
6373,5.0,Happy to have purchased this one for my birthday and this is the best,positive
6374,5.0,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.,positive
6375,3.0,Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product,negative
6376,5.0,This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality,positive
6377,5.0,It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.,positive
6378,5.0,The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.,positive
6379,4.0,Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.,positive
6380,5.0,Fun gadget for adults and kids. Great range for asking questions..,positive
6381,5.0,This is an excellent product - speaker quality is amazing.,positive
6382,5.0,Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.,positive
6383,4.0,"Good sound but unlike Echo, you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do. I ordered a Dot so this may solve that issue.",positive
6384,5.0,The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!,positive
6385,5.0,"You know, for about a year now I've been thinking of getting a portable speaker, so when the Tap was on sale I decided that this was the perfect answer since I was already committed to the Alexa paradigm.",positive
6386,5.0,"This is a great buy for music, news and any kind of information you want.",positive
6387,5.0,"This product works great as a little helper and as a great speaker for music. I purchased this for my mother in a nursing home, she loves it! It is very easy to set up and use.",positive
6388,5.0,It works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary,positive
6389,5.0,"Now that you don't have to actually tap it to get the full function out of it, its great. Have the original Echo, and the Dot also. Wish I had only bought two of these, the charge is great and we take it wherever we want to go.",positive
6390,5.0,Great to use as a portable speaker to take around with you as you work outside as long as you have a wifi connection. I use it with Pandora and Amazon unlimited music.,positive
6391,5.0,i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.,positive
6392,5.0,I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate,positive
6393,4.0,"Great Amazon tap, you can take Alexa anywhere. Love it, can do the big Alexa can do and more! No know issue safer...",positive
6394,4.0,This is a good alternative to the amazon echo. I like that supposedly it's not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa.,positive
6395,5.0,"Amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the AWS engine behind it, there's a lot of opportunity for development, both from the community as well as Amazon. Naturally they favor interaction with services they sell, so others will need to build links to others, but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already. The price of this TAP was outstanding, adding it to my existing ECHO and now considering a DOT.",positive
6396,5.0,"other than not being voice activated like the Echo, it's just as good if not better",positive
6397,4.0,sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi'sseems durable,positive
6398,2.0,"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose.",negative
6399,5.0,Love it's portability and and sound love all my Amazon echo items,positive
6400,5.0,"I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy.",positive
6401,5.0,"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want.",positive
6402,5.0,Sleep design and works great. Ideal gift for the person who has everything.,positive
6403,4.0,"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.",positive
6404,2.0,I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.,negative
6405,4.0,I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.,positive
6406,4.0,Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!,positive
6407,4.0,"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.",positive
6408,5.0,This is one of the coolest new inventions around. It is very innovative and works great. It's really neat asking Alexa to play different songs and telling it you are bored.,positive
6409,5.0,This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.,positive
6410,5.0,I wanted the technology but didn't want something that listens to the ever-present conversation in my home. The Amazon Tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen.It works and works very well.,positive
6411,5.0,"I bring it when hanging out outside, exercising, doing housework anywhere my echo won't hear me",positive
6412,5.0,"I utilize my Tap on my bedside table for wake up calls, playing rain sounds to help me go to sleep, set reminders for the middle of the night uh-ohs and play my fav music. I take my Tap to work with me as a cordless battery bluetooth speaker . . . best of both worlds.",positive
6413,4.0,Does as advertise. Good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers.,positive
6414,5.0,"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!",positive
6415,3.0,"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,",negative
6416,5.0,"I have missed my Pandora since I moved from Ft. Worth, TX to Colorado a few months ago. My nephew had the Amazon Tap and I was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it ( saying.. ALEXA.. tell MIMI (their Grandmother) to GO TO BED.. AND IT DID!! And the sound and quality of music coming from it. Awesome. :) I had to have one, so I went to local Best Buy and bought it. I even set it up myself (I'm 65 so was impressed with myself! LOL) but I have listened nonstop to 60s music or music from DIRTY DANCING (which I loved). I have ordered a little case from Amazon.com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room, which I have been doing. I feel like I have a new found friend.... love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as BOSE in my book! Get it, you'll love it! I DO!! :) VERY VERY pleased with it! Weather updates here or where my kdis are. Just checking. :)No interruptions or commercials when listening ALL DAY LONG!",positive
6417,4.0,got as a gift. Might not have got for my self- but love it and glad I had a birthday - lol,positive
6418,5.0,Wait for to be on sale it's worth it definitely you will love it,positive
6419,5.0,"Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use.",positive
6420,5.0,"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra.",positive
6421,3.0,"If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable.",negative
6422,4.0,"Works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like, just found out it supports dish network",positive
6423,5.0,We bought this product to compliment our other amazon product for its portability.,positive
6424,4.0,"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do.",positive
6425,5.0,I like the Amazon Tap because it is portable. I have used it several times and it makes things a lot easier.,positive
6426,5.0,Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.,positive
6427,5.0,Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.,positive
6428,5.0,There's a lot of features and we are just getting started with Tap. Glad we made the purchase!,positive
6429,5.0,I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use.,positive
6430,5.0,"best portable speaker I've ever owned. I use this everyday, mostly when getting ready in the morning or when I have guests over. Good sound quality and links to the Alexa app just like an Echo. It come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the Echo. Also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord.",positive
6431,5.0,great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside. the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one!,positive
6432,5.0,"Love having the wireless tap to use anywhere. It's small, sound is good. charges up quickly. Bough the sling to protect it outside.",positive
6433,4.0,"Must have for people who have an Amazon Prime account and an Echo. Portability and water resistant. Works great by the hot tub or pool, and let's you access the normal Alexis capabilities.",positive
6434,5.0,"I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do",positive
6435,4.0,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.",positive
6436,5.0,Lets me choose the type of music I love. Can even go to the beach with me using my sling.,positive
6437,4.0,Took awhile to get connected to my home wifi but now that it is it streams flawlessly with no lags in music. Doesn't have the dynamic sound range as other Bluetooth speakers i own.,positive
6438,5.0,It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station,positive
6439,5.0,"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no handsyou can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",positive
6440,4.0,This worked well as an extension of the Amazon Echo to cover our basement living area.,positive
6441,5.0,This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.,positive
6442,5.0,It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.,positive

6446,5.0,Enjoying my Amazon Tap portable Bluetooth and Wi-F Speaker. It's everything I thought it would be an MORE!,positive
6447,4.0,"If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers.",positive
6448,5.0,"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...",positive
6449,5.0,"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.",positive
6450,4.0,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift,positive
6451,5.0,This is awesome addition to the stationary Echo. I can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside. Great sound and long battery,positive
6452,5.0,It is a very handy device and I highly recommend it. I also enjoy using Alexa on it.,positive
6453,4.0,"Easy setup, love that its wireless and its fun talking to Alexa as she gives excellent information.",positive
6454,5.0,"Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great.",positive
6455,4.0,"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL.",positive
6456,5.0,"great device to listen to music,best blue tooth on the market today,I highly recommend it",positive
6457,5.0,"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!",positive
6458,5.0,Great additional piece to go with Echo. If you want a additional unit you can't beat this product and the price!,positive
6459,4.0,Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.,positive
6460,3.0,"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.",negative
6461,4.0,"very interesting device, but having to touch button is a pain sometimes.if that would bother you, then go with Echo.",positive
6462,3.0,Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..,negative
6463,5.0,"I absolutely love this speaker. It is easy to use and the app is user friendly. I have used it at the beach, pool, lake, and park I will not travel without it.",positive
6464,5.0,"Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!",positive
6465,5.0,It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends,positive
6466,5.0,We really enjoy our Alexa. I always have it for music. Lately we been movie times. The kids like to ask it silly questions and they can't get enough of it,positive
6467,5.0,Good speaker. I've learned to really like Alexa. She's more than a speaker. Lots of options. Carry it around for use on our outside decks.,positive
6468,5.0,Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!,positive
6469,5.0,"Hi Everyone, Alexa is the best of the best. I feel like she knows me more and more each week. She is a STRONG speaker for my love of music. She knows like everything ever. I ask her crazy facts and she always responds with something. She does struggle a little with recent events. But that will get better with time. She is my home personal assistant and assists with managing my calendar. In a word. AWESOME!",positive
6470,4.0,"I bought this unit because I needed a portable bluetooth speaker. When it was on sale, I figured why not get Alexa with it. It works well. I plan to use it when I am overseas in my hotel. We'll see how that goes.",positive
6471,4.0,"Love that the Tap is portable. Drag it all around the house and outside. I'm not an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is very good except at the highest level. Only wish it was always listening when it is charging on the dock.",positive
6472,1.0,I feel like I have been completely lied to about this device. Despite reviews claiming a hands free mode that does not exist in the settings. I just downloaded the app for the first time today and there is no hands free option to enable in settings. And Pandora said it's not available in the US on this Amazon tap. Thanks for ruining a birthday Amazon,negative
6473,5.0,"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift.",positive
6474,3.0,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",negative
6475,5.0,"Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it.",positive
6476,5.0,Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.,positive
6477,5.0,"Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button",positive
6478,5.0,We bought to give away at a Halloween party. We own them ourselves and they are awesome,positive
6479,5.0,Very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online. It sounds very good for it's size.,positive
6480,5.0,I wanted to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use while out as well as at home. The tap has great sound quality and Alexa is more useful than I would have thought.,positive
6481,5.0,This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out,positive
6482,5.0,"The Tap has been wonderful! We use it as a timer, for a weather update and for general music. The sound is terrific. I would recommend this unit. It is certainly easy to use - just a tap away.",positive
6483,4.0,"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.",positive
6484,4.0,"I have several echo dots around my home, but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn't have one and control things around the house, listen to the news or music. It holds a great charge.",positive
6485,5.0,Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.,positive
6486,5.0,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,positive
6487,4.0,"Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa..... The Tap sits next to my bed on the nite stand where I can easily call up ijnfo from my bed or as I walk by during the day or nite. Especially useful for a review of my calendar so I can review my upcoming days plans. Try Alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house!",positive
6488,5.0,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,positive
6489,4.0,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,positive
6490,2.0,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.",negative
6491,4.0,"I bought this to listen to music. I do not use the Alexa feature all that much. The feature does work great, but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak. The speakers work great. I can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it. Bass is decent. I would recommend to someone.",positive
6492,4.0,Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.,positive
6493,4.0,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",positive
6494,4.0,I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.,positive
6495,5.0,I purchased the Amazon Tap when it was on sale for around $80. The sound is amazing (unlike my Amazon Echo it has stereo speakers!) and the battery life is great! It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can stream from the internet or from your mobile device. Highly recommended!,positive
6496,4.0,"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up.",positive
6497,5.0,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.",positive
6498,4.0,Tap makes a great mobile Alexa device. Not as loud as Echo but still louder than the Dot. Voice enabled Alexa works but doesn't detect voice as easy as the Echo or Dot. As a mobile Bluetooth speaker though it works fine.,positive
6499,3.0,"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting",negative
6500,5.0,I have an Amazon Echo and an Amazon Dot. Love the functionality. Decent sound for what they are. I just wanted something portable for outside.,positive
6501,5.0,This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!,positive
6502,4.0,We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.,positive
6503,5.0,Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!,positive
6504,5.0,"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!",positive
6505,5.0,"I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Dot. The Echo Tap is the best of both and Portable. I have echos in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the patio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Alexa and wifi. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Alexa now more than she talks to me.",positive
6506,5.0,"Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can.",positive
6507,5.0,Now that this supports hands free access and amazon has discontinued it this is the last chance to get a battery operated echo device.,positive
6508,3.0,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.",negative
6509,5.0,"I bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening. She had a huuuge portable speaker that didn't sound very good and used many double 'd' batteries. This one sounds better and lasts all day. I was concerned she wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it. She loves it and that is a good thing.",positive
6510,1.0,Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.,negative
6511,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!",positive
6512,5.0,I believe this is the best Amazon device because of the portability. Quality seems good. Works well with no problems so far. It's a great portable Bluetooth speaker with alexa.,positive
6513,5.0,Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.,positive
6514,5.0,"The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to ""tap"" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable.",positive
6515,5.0,"I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music.",positive
6516,3.0,"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!",negative
6517,5.0,"I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!",positive
6518,4.0,I like the product itself but its app is very slow esp. outside the U.S. when you are on the go.,positive
6519,5.0,"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music.",positive
6520,5.0,Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets,positive
6521,2.0,Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).,negative
6522,5.0,Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody,positive
6523,4.0,Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.,positive
6524,4.0,I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack,positive
6525,5.0,Enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good.,positive
6526,5.0,"Smart, timely, very effective around the house. I have a Dot as well but the Tap has MUCH better sound. I had a Google Earth and replaced it with the TAP because Google was not as smart as Tappy!",positive
6527,5.0,This is a great product! Would definitely recommend this item!,positive
6528,5.0,I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.,positive
6529,4.0,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.",positive
6530,5.0,Great product works direct with internet access or through your phone,positive
6531,5.0,good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.,positive
6532,5.0,"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.",positive
6533,5.0,"Great speaker, Love using voice commands, Even my granddaughters use the voice command to search for songs.",positive
6534,5.0,"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.",positive
6535,5.0,"Love the sound quality, perfect for what l needed it for.",positive
6536,5.0,This speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it's got the Alexa application!,positive
6537,5.0,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",positive
6538,5.0,This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it,positive
6539,4.0,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.",positive
6540,5.0,I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!,positive
6541,5.0,"Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!",positive
6542,4.0,"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.",positive
6543,5.0,Excellent product. Lots of upgrades to Tap since original release. A joy to use.,positive
6544,5.0,"The Amazon Tap is a great mobile Bluetooth speakers, if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system. The produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the Echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the Echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work).",positive
6545,5.0,Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price,positive
6546,5.0,This has all the benefits of the Echo for a slightly better price. I also love the portability.,positive
6547,5.0,"Works great if you plan to have it in arms reach. You have to physically tap it to ask Alexa. Store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap, not voice activate. Returned to wait for indefinite out-of-stock Echo to get in eventually.",positive
6548,5.0,Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.,positive
6549,4.0,For its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and I love the portability.,positive
6550,5.0,I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.,positive
6551,2.0,Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.,negative
6552,5.0,Great tech works well highly recommended no issues,positive
6553,5.0,"This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household.",positive
6554,5.0,Looked at the Echo before we bought this and I would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable. This has everything we need and then some.,positive
6555,5.0,"It's not the echo but for what I paid, it's well worth every penny",positive
6556,4.0,Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.,positive
6557,4.0,"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming",positive
6558,5.0,It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift.,positive
6559,5.0,Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions,positive
6560,5.0,Tap is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.,positive
6561,5.0,"I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forcast and local events. Great purchase.",positive
6562,5.0,"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR",positive
6563,5.0,Amazon Tap is exactly what I expected it would be. The sound quality is good with the Alexa features. I love that you can charge it on the base or with micro USB cord. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Amazon Echo and would like the portability.,positive
6564,4.0,If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.,positive
6565,5.0,I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.,positive
6566,5.0,"I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.",positive
6567,5.0,I love this speaker it works wonderfully. Very recommend,positive
6568,5.0,Love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms. Has a decent amount of Bass for the size.,positive
6569,4.0,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,positive
6570,3.0,"Doesn't understand some commands or Questions,but good overall",negative
6571,4.0,"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone.",positive
6572,1.0,Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,negative
6573,4.0,I enjoy it. It's gray for reading and working out.,positive
6574,4.0,Great concept but speaker not so good at full volume. And maybe better now with the updates,positive
6575,5.0,This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.,positive
6576,5.0,We now have one for everyone in the family and no longer share. I would have no problem recommending this to a friend.,positive
6577,2.0,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution.",negative
6578,5.0,"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands…you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",positive
6579,5.0,"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge.",positive
6580,5.0,"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing.",positive
6581,5.0,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",positive
6582,5.0,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",positive
6583,5.0,"This speaker puts out some great sounds and has lots of options for connections. And, it is Alexa commandable.",positive
6584,4.0,"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget.",positive
6585,5.0,Smaller version but works great just like the bigger product.,positive
6586,5.0,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",positive
6587,5.0,My son requested this a a birthday gift. He is enjoying it everyday.,positive
6588,4.0,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,positive
6589,4.0,If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.,positive
6590,4.0,"I bought it for my husband for a gift but I use it as much as he does. Perfect size, good sound quality overall great product.",positive
6591,5.0,I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!,positive
6592,5.0,Awesome speaker easy to set up. Easy to play. Great by the pool,positive
6593,5.0,Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.,positive
6594,5.0,Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.,positive
6595,1.0,This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.,negative
6596,5.0,Great product for intro to an AI device. Cant wait to upgrade to echo.,positive
6597,5.0,"I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!",positive
6598,5.0,"WAS SURPRISED HOW GREAT THIS WORKS , MUSIC ASK IT QUESTIONS AWESOME",positive
6599,4.0,Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!,positive

6604,4.0,"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account.",positive
6605,5.0,Great speaker sound and ease of setup. Works great with Amazon music option.,positive
6606,5.0,Amazon is the tip of leading technology. Always have had great luck with their product.,positive
6607,4.0,I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,positive
6608,5.0,"It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more",positive
6609,3.0,Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...,negative

6618,5.0,"I didn't want something that was always monitoring room conversations. This appears to only listen when I tap it, and that is much more acceptable to me. Works great. :-)",positive
6619,3.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,negative
6620,5.0,"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.",positive
6621,5.0,This is a great piece of hardware...I love it. really good all around..,positive
6622,5.0,"In my search for a wireless speaker, I looked at various models and decided on this one because of the portability, the look and how it synced with Alexa. I have an Alexa and this product was spot on! The sound is great! I use it in the balcony and stream all music from pandora, different stations and the quality is great!! Definitely would recommend!",positive
6623,5.0,You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.,positive

6628,5.0,Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!,positive
6629,5.0,Once the tap was able to be activated by voice I started to have some interest. Having said that I notice I do use the 'Tap' button when I have it in my hand. We use it mostly outside and by our hot tub. Took is on vacation this last week and use it at the beach using cell phone as an access point.,positive
6630,5.0,"Much more than a Bluetooth speaker. It is great to listen to music from Pandora, Amazon, etc with it streaming directly from wifi. Saves the battery on my phone. As others have said I wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but I guess they didn't put that in to save battery life. Maybe something for the next generation TAp",positive
6631,5.0,"I love that this works just like the dot, which I already have 3. However in addition it is portable and has better speaker",positive
6632,5.0,I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.,positive
6633,4.0,Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.,positive
6634,5.0,"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.",positive
6635,5.0,"Overall, I am very impressed with the Amazon Tap. The sound quality isn't the best out there, but the portability makes up for this. The volume is decent as well. There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase.",positive
6636,5.0,Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up,positive
6637,4.0,Love it great speaker as long as u have access to WiFi,positive
6638,5.0,I have a few top end Bluetooth speakers and this Amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in,positive
6639,5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my husband. He is not a tech person, I was afraid he would be intimidated but he loves it.",positive
6640,5.0,"Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him",positive
6641,4.0,"This was my first Alexa device and until I got a dot I was very satisfied with it After the Dot, I missed the voice activation. No Amazon has updated the software to where it will respond to voice commands so not problems with it at all . You need to keep it on the charge stand if you are going to use voice commands.",positive
6642,5.0,The sound out of this little cylinder is incredible.,positive
6643,4.0,No issues at all... wish it were water proof. My kids and family love it.,positive
6644,5.0,"We already had an Alexa but this one is a great addition. It's portable, rechargeable and good sound.",positive
6645,5.0,"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo.",positive
6646,4.0,Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.,positive
6647,5.0,"Bought the Tap for my mom to primarily listen to music. Although my mom forgets ""the girl's name"" haha, we've found Alexa will answer without saying her name. The rechargeable base is nice so the Tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi. Sound is great, too! Pleased!",positive
6648,5.0,"Works great, sound is clear and is really loud. Would recommend",positive
6649,5.0,"I have an echo, tap and a dot. Currently my tap serves as a Bluetooth speaker for my dot - making it more like the echo, but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere. It has really good sound much like my echo. It also works great in the app and syncs with all my other products.",positive
6650,5.0,"I have a regular echo and now the tap. Both awesome products, use them to control lights, locks, and play music. Would buy again.",positive
6651,5.0,This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.,positive
6652,5.0,Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,positive
6653,4.0,works as expected. great Christmas present for the kids.,positive
6654,2.0,"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund",negative
6655,5.0,Bought as a family gift. We use it all the time now. Very helpful and covenient,positive
6656,5.0,If you have Prime this is the best thing you can buy!,positive
6657,5.0,I gave this to my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a portable speaker. I thought the addition of Alexa would be fun. She loves it. She said the sound is really great.,positive
6658,5.0,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",positive
6659,4.0,"Good, but not overall as capable or comprehensive as I was hoping. Will continue to explore capabilities and Apps.",positive
6660,4.0,I really liked this tablet. Got it for my nephew who just turned 4. Has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained. The bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too. What I also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too.,positive
6661,5.0,"Great product at a great price from Best Buy. Have to press a button rather than just saying her name, but that's the price you pay for it being cordless.",positive
6662,5.0,"What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office.",positive
6663,4.0,"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.",positive
6664,5.0,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,positive
6665,5.0,"i got one for my mom she's 90 years young and she sits and listens to it all day, she;s got the amazon tap i got my draugther the dot and i got my self another tap. i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better. my grand kids love playing ganes with alexa. like i said every household need one",positive
6666,1.0,We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.,negative
6667,4.0,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.",positive
6668,4.0,"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice.",positive
6669,4.0,It's nice and portable and works well on the go. Wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button.,positive
6670,5.0,I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.,positive
6671,5.0,I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.,positive
6672,2.0,"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """,negative
6673,5.0,The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.,positive
6674,5.0,I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.,positive
6675,5.0,This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.,positive
6676,5.0,"I have a lot of things in my home automated and we use Alexa as a part of that. I'd wanted a portable Alexa to use in our deck area and first look at a Tap late 2016. I ruled it out because the user had to touch it to enable Alexa which isn't convenient. I purchased a Dot battery pack and it worked okay but once I dropped and broke it, I needed a new solution. I knew that Amazon had added voice activation so I bought a Tap. It is great. Sound quality is good enough for me and it is a semi-rugged Alexa device we can port around outside.",positive
6677,5.0,"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.",positive
6678,4.0,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.",positive
6679,4.0,I've enjoyed using the features Alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers. The sound quality is good.,positive
6680,5.0,"It has sleep timer capability alarm I use it at work, or use it at home while I'm in the shower and I'll bring it to Friends houses and we use Alexa to gain information or just have fun. quality a 9 its loud too.",positive
6681,4.0,"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word ""Alexis"", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household.",positive
6682,4.0,"I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself.",positive
6683,4.0,Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.,positive
6684,5.0,"The Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. It has a hands free option, it works well both as a way to take Alexa on the road and as your primary Alexa device at home., the Tap doesn't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers in its price range. It's not waterproof and Alexa doesn't work at all without Wi-Fi. but still pretty cool and heaper than the Echo.",positive
6685,5.0,Amzon tap is great and fun Bluetooth speaker with inbuilt Alexa. I can talk it to end of the room and it can still understand my commands and plays music. Cool device and I highly recommend it.,positive
6686,5.0,"The whole family is using it. Music, Bluetooth speaker, questions, game times, sports scores. Love the portability.",positive
6687,5.0,"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!",positive
6688,5.0,This speaker sound great. I was surprised at how loud it gets. The sound is clear and you also have Alexa so that's a win.,positive
6689,2.0,"Love the Dot, Hate the Tap Portable! This device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though.",negative
6690,5.0,purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.,positive
6691,4.0,Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.,positive
6692,5.0,It's a nice item but really there's other things that do the same thing. So we actually returned it.,positive
6693,5.0,It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.,positive
6694,4.0,The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.,positive
6695,4.0,Awesome. I really enjoy using it. The portability is a plus!,positive
6696,4.0,Great speaker. Love how its portable. Good battery life. Would be 5 stars if it had the drop in capabilities like the rest of the echo family.,positive
6697,1.0,I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn’t appreciate.,negative
6698,5.0,Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.,positive
6699,4.0,Good product but requires hands on to operate. Good if sitting close but not if you're mobile. Wold be great if portable and hands free. Returned it and ordered the Dot.,positive
6700,1.0,"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79",negative
6701,5.0,The ease of Alexa in performing functions is second to none. SIRI who?,positive
6702,4.0,"I( read the reviews and even listened to this in store. But much to my chagrin, at high volume, this will not cut it. The portability is great!",positive
6703,4.0,"Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound. AI app Alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches. Overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool,",positive
6704,4.0,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats",positive
6705,5.0,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",positive
6706,4.0,"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it.",positive
6707,2.0,I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.,negative
6708,5.0,This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button,positive
6709,5.0,"This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it.",positive
6710,5.0,The tap is amazing. portable and connected to all amazon content,positive
6711,4.0,"I am a huge fan of the echo. That being said this is the last one I would buy. The original echo's speaker sounds much better and is hands free. The dot has great connection Bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system. I bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard. The sound is not as robust as the original echo (not portable - no internal battery), but good enough when in the yard to at least have music.",positive
6712,5.0,I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.,positive
6713,3.0,"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa",negative
6714,5.0,"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.",positive
6715,5.0,The speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable. I can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in.,positive
6716,5.0,"Speaker is really cool. Sounds great, easy to use. Love the fact that it is portable. Only downside I see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button (not always listening)",positive
6717,5.0,The tap is a great product! Access to Alexa in a grab and go format!,positive
6718,5.0,This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.,positive
6719,5.0,"Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its ""Hands-Free"" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...",positive
6720,4.0,Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.,positive
6721,5.0,"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!",positive
6722,5.0,"I like its flexibility, portability and it is the best value option of all three Alexas",positive
6723,5.0,For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.,positive
6724,5.0,Love it ... need to get some smart appliances! I also got the Echo dot - wish I got these items sooner,positive
6725,5.0,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.,positive
6726,5.0,This is so easy to operate and fun too! I love it!!,positive
6727,5.0,Great product with a ton of features. Add the Echo Dot to get even more out of it,positive
6728,5.0,"Fun and easy to use, install app and navigation.Good quality technology.",positive
6729,5.0,This is such a great product I have two of them! Would highly recommend.,positive
6730,4.0,I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!,positive
6731,5.0,I have the Echo and I just love it... I bought the Tap for my daughter for Christmas so she does not know she has it yet.,positive
6732,5.0,Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.,positive
6733,5.0,"Love, love, love this! Can't wait to use it on our deck this summer!",positive
6734,5.0,"Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it.",positive
6735,5.0,Makes for a great alarm and reminder device. I own 2 dots and the tap. Use them all.,positive
6736,5.0,"Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you.",positive
6737,5.0,I love its portability! The speakers are phenomenal!,positive
6738,5.0,Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound,positive
6739,5.0,Brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Great product for the price.,positive
6740,5.0,I love Alexa! She has been a great addition! Would recommend her to anyone,positive
6741,5.0,My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.,positive
6742,5.0,It's amazing! I love how loud it plays the music!!,positive
6743,3.0,Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that,negative
6744,5.0,"With the new update allowing hands-free ""Hey Alexa"" commands, this is a great device. The battery allows you to disconnect from the wall. The sound is very good and fills a small room well with decent levels. Alexa is very accurate (most of the time) to voice commands. My only complaint is that Bluetooth streaming from devices (like my iPhone or iPad) sometimes breaks up and stutters a bit. Other than that, I think this is a great device.",positive
6745,5.0,I would recommend it. It is fun to use and puts out good sound.,positive
6746,5.0,I love this .. Great extra for my amazon echo .. Does everything it does but it's cordless .. Keeps charge for many days .. Push button to activate .. Wireless speaker also out of wifi .. Really cool !!,positive
6747,4.0,I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price,positive
6748,4.0,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap,positive
6749,5.0,Don't know how I managed without Alexa. Everyone in the family is enjoying her.,positive
6750,5.0,I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.,positive
6751,5.0,Sounds great. Must touch to activate. Easy to use.,positive
6752,5.0,"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking.",positive
6753,5.0,Has good sound for little speaker & good for getting information with out getting up.,positive
6754,5.0,Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!,positive
6755,5.0,This speaker is great for the price. I love how the speaker is 360 degrees so you get the same sound in any part of the room.,positive
6756,5.0,It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.,positive
6757,5.0,What a terrific device. You can ask it anything and she has an answer. It's small enough to place anywhere so it doesn't look instructive,positive
6758,5.0,"Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!",positive
6759,5.0,"easy to use , sound is great, i use it any where in the house",positive
6760,4.0,"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",positive
6761,5.0,"Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask ""her"" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have ""her"" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device.",positive
6762,5.0,"Didn't know I would like it this much, but it's wonderful. I use it mostly for streaming music from Pandora. I love that I don't have to rely on another device and connect via bluetooth like other speakers and the sound it great!",positive
6763,5.0,Loud enough for small gatherings & very responsive to commands.,positive
6764,5.0,"Fantastic, better response then SIRIAmazon Prime account gives you complete control",positive
6765,5.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.,positive
6766,5.0,"A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price.",positive
6767,5.0,Bought it for Father's Day and my dad and mom love it!,positive
6768,4.0,I like the Amazon Tap. I use it as a speaker in my garage for working out. It is tied to my Amazon Echo. I am able to use Alexa and Amazon Prime material. Would highly recommend.,positive
6769,4.0,He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs,positive
6770,4.0,"Gave as a gift.Did not know you had to ""tap"" it before you talk. Thought it was like echo.Anyway, they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk.Really likes that it is battery powered, portable.",positive
6771,5.0,"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more",positive
6772,5.0,These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!,positive
6773,5.0,This is a must for Prime members great sound and can be used as Bluetooth speaker to boot.,positive
6774,4.0,Love having someone to take notes for me and play music on demand.,positive
6775,5.0,"I love my Amazon Tap. I was in the market for a portable speaker and I saw these one on sale so I decided to pick it up. I only wanted it for a Bluetooth speaker, but Alexa is amazing I use it everyday. Alexa was a huge plus.",positive
6776,3.0,My Echo hasn't updated to the latest version that allows for hands-free operation. I'm not sure what the problem is.,negative
6777,3.0,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",negative
6778,5.0,Even as a speaker alone this item is worth the price!,positive
6779,5.0,I really enjoy it love the sound and it's really easy,positive
6780,5.0,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,positive
6781,5.0,The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it,positive
6782,5.0,"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.",positive
6783,4.0,"I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use ""Always On"" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using ""Always On"" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere",positive
6784,4.0,"Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to.",positive
6785,4.0,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.",positive
6786,5.0,Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.,positive
6787,3.0,Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,negative
6788,5.0,"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a ""beat box"" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a ""beat box"" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well.",positive
6789,4.0,"This is a fun and convenient toy, but I'm surprised about some of the limitations. I keep hearing the same NPR news clip when I ask for news or headline news. I would like more news highlights. When I ask for 80s music, Echo starts with the same 1 of 3 songs each time.",positive
6790,5.0,"Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price",positive
6791,5.0,Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend,positive
6792,5.0,"Tap is a portable Amazon Echo with speakers. Great for carrying to basement or upstairs. Works like echo but not voice activated, you must ""tap"" it before talking.",positive
6793,5.0,Nice price for a gift idea at the time. Small compact version of Alexa.,positive
6794,5.0,"It's very easy to connect devices, and it produces a good sound. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",positive
6795,5.0,"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do  including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source.",positive
6796,5.0,I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.,positive
6797,5.0,I literally use this thing every single day. Love it.,positive
6798,5.0,I absolutely love my amazon echo. It is very convenient and handy.,positive
6799,5.0,"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it.",positive
6800,5.0,"The Amazon Fire TV works better and faster than the Fire Stick. Every aspect of this is better, watching every show or movie starts up fast and is much clearer.",positive
6801,4.0,I like the product and would tell others about it.,positive
6802,5.0,"Really like the voice commands, including commands outside the typical, movie/tv expectation (like the weather). Haven't used it as much as i thought i would, but set up (for the things i want to do) is fair....",positive
6803,5.0,Got it so I can have everything in one device and it does that flawless. It's very fast and responsive and the voice search is really good,positive
6804,4.0,Like the voice command option to search for shows I want to watch.,positive
6805,4.0,"Decent, but have to reset monthly, i have to unplug and at times re enter my pass cause this freezes or stops completely. You can add KODI though. i would still but one for living rm though.",positive
6806,4.0,Great purchase and good investment.Also wonderful viewing,positive
6807,5.0,Follow the instruction on youtube and you can jailbreak this item to get access to movies still in theaters.,positive
6808,5.0,"Works as described, happy with the purchase.got another one for the room ..",positive
6809,4.0,Works exactly as I hoped and have had no issues. There is virtually every app you might need available to you.,positive
6810,5.0,"I really get the most of my Amazon Prime Video now. I find it is easy and responsive to use. The main pain is having to change the Input so you have to use three controllers, the media controller, the cable controller and the original TV controller. Fortunately I'm used to that with my Apple TV. It is less fussy than the Apple TV especially when you view Amazon content. Well it naturally would be because the content is automatically there.",positive
6811,5.0,I don't know why i waited to long to get this product especially since i have amazon prime. Gives me instant access to prime movies and has built in alexa what more can you ask for. Simply great .,positive
6812,5.0,It's processor is super fast plus plays movies & tv shows so clear! I love it!! Best money I ever spent!!,positive
6813,5.0,"I recently got rid of cable and WiFi at home as it all just became way too expensive. I wanted something that would run off of my hotspot on my phone as I have an unlimited plan. It connects to it as soon as I have it on, there is no lagging, doesn't take long to load any of my streaming services either. It is very easy to navigate through the menu and do everything. Steup was a breeze, I love the voice feature (definitely comes in handy).",positive
6814,5.0,Fire box was a perfect up grade to my TV entertainment system. The ability to show 4k movies made it perfect. My daughter gets to see her cartoons and I get to see my action movies perfectly. You can use Ethernet and dual band wifi. Its so much in a small box with a low price. ITS PERFECT!,positive
6815,5.0,Easy connection and very good playing different apps.,positive
6816,4.0,"This device is very easy to set up as long as you know your wifi password, Amazon account information, and a TV with an available HDMI port. FYI...You must have an Amazon account to use this device.",positive
6817,3.0,"I bought this and an AppleTV at the same time. The FireTV is just kinda OK. The interface isn't that intuitive and could use some polish. I had to enter the same username and password for multiple apps over and over (you only have to do it once on the AppleTV)...may not sound like that big of a deal, but it took much longer to setup.In my opinion, the AppleTV is a better product.",negative
6818,5.0,"I had the Fire stick, and the performance was sluggish at best, constant buffering and powering off. I upgraded to the Fire tv and the difference is night and day. I don't know why I waited! no issues thus far and I couldn't be happier.",positive
6819,5.0,Way better than the Amazon stick. No buffering love it,positive
6820,4.0,We enjoy this product more than our roku device. It works great.,positive
6821,5.0,"I love everything about this item. I can watch whatever, whenever, particularly on Kodi. Good bye and good riddance to cable!",positive
6822,3.0,"I returned this and purchased the 4th generation Apple TV instead, I liked the Apple features better. If you're not",negative
6823,5.0,this is best box I ever buy to watch movies and tv shows,positive
6824,5.0,"BYE BYE CABLE TV, KODI ON THE FIRE TV TAKES OVER..YES SIR",positive
6825,4.0,This fire TV is really awesome for viewing content the Amazon video is really great and has lots of content,positive
6826,3.0,"I'm mostly happy, but like so many electronics, this one has a huge of built in advertising that you just can't get away from. There is no way to identify the aps you want to see first, and it always defaults the first click to an advertised movie for sell. It takes many clicks to get where I want, and the voice only works for purchases from Amazon, everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using clicks.",negative
6827,5.0,Comes with a bunch of apps to watch TV and to play games as well.,positive
6828,4.0,Best purchase you will ever make. Intall kodi and go cable free,positive
6829,5.0,I had a fire stick but I gave it away to a family member. I then went to purchase another one but they only had the fire tv in stock. So I reluctantly brought it but I am so much happier now that I have a tv box.,positive
6830,5.0,"Cable is too expensive. Especially when you can buy this and get more than you ever expected. You can expand the memory at will, you can watch literally anything, and although the remote is awful, there's an iPhone app that allows you to toss that unreliable remote in the trash. Get this thing, thank me later.",positive
6831,4.0,"Works great, easy to use. Affordable, worth the cost.",positive
6832,4.0,its a good box if you dont mind the amazon restrictions,positive
6833,5.0,It works well for what I am using it for. To access shows.,positive
6834,5.0,I bought when this was on sale. Good investment!!!,positive
6835,5.0,"I recently decided to be a cord cutter and not have cable anymore, just internet. I currently have a Samsung 60"" Smart 4K UHD and the Samsung 4K Blu-Ray player and a PC that I use to access all my online content.I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV and discovered that I already have access to just about everything the Amazon Fire TV has through mny TV, Blu-ray player and PC.This is a great device but for me it was just redundant.",positive
6836,5.0,Works awesome!! I would recommend getting one fast!!,positive
6837,4.0,This is so much faster than the fire stick. It also provides full support for sling tv and PlayStation vue which Apple TV has not. This has replaced our Apple TV as the primary streamer.,positive
6838,4.0,"This is a great product. But, may not be worth the extra money. You can likely get away with buying the Fire Stick.",positive
6839,5.0,"Amazon Fire TV is a great addition to our household. It offers tons of programs and I love getting my amazon prime movies this way. Easy to install, easy to navigate the menu, and an overall A+ in my book.",positive
6840,5.0,"After receiving another extremely high cable bill, I decided to cut the cord! The Amazon Fire is awesome. We subscribed to Playstation Vue which has an app on the Fire that you can access.We can also access our Amazons and Netflix accounts right from the Fire. Great product, wish I would have done this sooner.",positive
6841,5.0,"Fast, easy, and mobile! Connects through WiFi and directly. Easy to move from one room to another.",positive
6842,5.0,"Easy to use, I'm able to move it to other tvs in the house and bring it with us on vacation",positive
6843,5.0,Awesome! Really small size and fits perfect without taking a lot of space on the entertainment rack. Love it so far! 4K is awesome and definitely recommended! Make sure you are using the HDMI port specifically for HDCP 2.2 on your TV.,positive
6844,5.0,Works great! I like it better than cable. My new favorite device to watch movies and tv shows. My kids like the games that are available.,positive
6845,4.0,I had the firestick but upgraded to the box. Easy to use and with the straight connection to the Internet it is super fast.,positive
6846,5.0,"I have been a user of Roku and Apple TV before and I absolutely love the Fire TV. What prompted me to change from Roku was the availability of Playstation Vue. We are cord cutters and Vue is a better value than Sling TV.The Fire TV works well and has most all the channels we used on our old Roku. The only thing that doesn't work 100% is Vudu or other UltraViolet streaming services. The closest thing is Flixster, but some of the titles don't carry over right away. Most of the movies come through just fine, but the Flixster app on the Fire TV doesn't seem to bring over the TV shows I have purchased. Other than that, it works very well. Of course, if you watch a lot of Prime TV or use Amazon's Instant Video service you will really love the integration here.",positive
6847,5.0,Would recommend this to a friend. We are enjoying it a lot.,positive
6848,5.0,The best streaming device of all the ones i have tried.,positive
6849,5.0,Very fast and reliable fits easy behind tv upload apps and view video in 4000k,positive

6854,4.0,"Amazon Fire TV is really easy to setup. It also has given me an easy way to stream 4K media for any service, Amazon, Netflix, etc. The quality of the picture and sound is really good. The menu is easy to follow, and it is so much more advanced than the Apple TV. I especially like the App you can use to control The Fire TV from my I-phone or I- Pad.",positive
6855,4.0,Was looking for something different but see such a good deal,positive
6856,5.0,Great for doing the cord cutting. So far so good..,positive
6857,5.0,I was told by buying a new receiver that listed Netflix on the box that it was a good deal. Not so. Best Buy explained how this worked and saved me a lot of money. Gotta love this place!!,positive

6863,4.0,"Faster than the fire stick and more memory, so less maintenance. I would of given 5 stars, but you have to buy a hdmi cable unlike the stick which just plugs in.",positive
6864,4.0,"Pros:-Fast-nice looking interface-good design-great voice search-good amount of most useful appsCons:-It can get tedious to scroll all the way to right to find the app you want.-They have many of the ""main"" apps but they're still missing quite a few apps that are available on other set-top boxes (Cinemax, Vudu, apps offering 4K content, etc.)-They don't have enough games considering they make the gaming aspect one of their main points of advertising.- Only 8GB of space and you can't use the MicroSD card as extended storage until they upgrade to Marshmallow.- Very Amazon-centricPlease be aware that you cannot play many of the games you can play on your Fire tablet or even your Android phone with Amazon appstore on the Fire TV.",positive
6865,5.0,"I recently dropped my cable provider and i had been using the Amazon Firestick which works great. The Fire TV was on sale and, since we have 2 tvs, i bought it. Couldn't believe the beautiful picture on my Samsung tv. I subscribed to HBO, Amazon Prime, and Showtime so I dropped my monthly bill with Directv from $190 to $30 and i have a ton more content.",positive
6866,5.0,Performance and interface are great!!! And you can add most of Android apps too!!!,positive

6880,5.0,Great funtionality and the remote with voice control is great. Better expierence than chromecast. The remote and streaming quality is superior than the chromescast solution.,positive
6881,5.0,is no word happy happy it hard to get up cause there no commercial so l have to fix something to eat before watching a move or do what l need to do frist so many movies it hard to pick what to watch,positive

6885,4.0,First one died within hours of setting it up. Returned and reluctantly got a second. This one has been solid.... So far.,positive
6886,5.0,"Best Buy had a sale on the FireTV and I jumped at it. I was most interested in the speed increase over our FireTV Stick. I have been very pleased with the upgrade. I like having a microphone on the remote to do voice searches... or now Alexa commands (""turn on the lights"", ""trigger"" IFTTT scripts). The speed over launching a navigate apps is much improved (we have been using PS Vue a good bit).Very pleased :)",positive
6887,5.0,The box is really good and it has everything to you need to watch when it comes to online watching,positive
6888,4.0,"This device is great for any streaming needs, with a quad core mobile processor and 2 gb of ram this device has no problems handling any of your digital needs. Not to mention the AC wireless receiver and option to plug in usb devices and sd cards. I would highly recommend this device for anyone",positive
6889,5.0,The Fire TV works great. Bought it mainly for my kids to watch their shows in their room without adding another cable box and wiring to my home. I am an Amazon Prime Member and the free content available is sufficient for all the kids regardless of age. We're talking 6 to 20 years old! The remote was a little temperamental at first but has been working fine after a regular software update.,positive
6890,5.0,An awesome product. Getting my money's worth. I would truly recommend this product.,positive
6891,5.0,This was one of my best purchases hundreds of great movies and shows available.,positive
6892,2.0,I was quite disappointed when I began working through the menus and discovered that my 2 year old Roku 3 was far more intuitive. Roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services. If I am already paying a subscription fee to Netflix or HBO NOW and I can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should I pay Amazon to watch it? I am a fan of Amazon services and a Prime member but I also don't want to throw my money away. Roku is still the best.,negative

6896,5.0,So far the best streaming system I have tried. Even better than Appletv.,positive
6897,5.0,It does everything that it is suppose to. It does seam to be a little slow over wifi. Does seam to buffer now and then So much faster then my Apple TV! I love it! Netflix loads instantly and very clear!,positive

6904,4.0,Some channels still glitchy but overall great hardware.,positive
6905,5.0,"I love that this guy supports 4K content since I just recently bought a 4K TV. Please be aware that if you don't already have an Amazon account, you'll have to set one up before using it. You can set it up through the Fire TV, but It'd be best if you just do it through a computer because the process to set up the account through the device I tedious and frustrating at times.",positive
6906,5.0,I came in to purchase a different streaming device and the store associate recommended this one instead. Glad I decided to stop in the store instead of paying more for the other device online.,positive

6912,5.0,"Originally purchased the fire TV Stick, upgraded for more bandwith and storage, awesome product.",positive
6913,5.0,"I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV for use in a spare room. I subscribe to various platforms including Netflix and Playstation Vue. Although I am on a wireless connection, playback has been smooth, with almost no glitches. Not to mention, the picture quality has been superb (this can vary depending on the bandwidth of your internet connection). Setup was a breeze and it is very intuitive; so much so, that my 9 year old can use it with no problems (and after applying parental controls of course).",positive

So much faster loading everything. Amazed at how when you choose a video to watch and hit play, its there. instantly. Amazing.",positive
6919,4.0,First one had issues from the update that was loaded upon installation. Returned and waited several weeks before buying a replacement. Seems to work better.,positive
6920,4.0,I love my fire tv. The only thing I don't like is my remote keep freezing. I have already change the batteries to brand new ones twice and it still freezes. I'm ready to buy a new remote.,positive

6922,5.0,"Very valueble product, very easy to use, many features, way better than the stick, wont be disappointed.",positive
6923,5.0,"A friend at work mentioned this product and told me that it is pretty decent for movies. I am amazed at just how much content you can access on this fire tv box. If you like to watch tv; movies, cable series and play games you can't go wrong with this purchase.",positive

6932,5.0,Compared to the rest this is amazing especially the price.,positive
6933,5.0,I bought a sony vue/PlayStation vue product to now watch cable tv. I found the channel guide to load a little slow when using the fire stick. that got me to invest in the faster processor and buy an amazon TV. I use the main TV that use and use the less expensive fire sticks for my other 2 TV's.,positive
6934,5.0,Was looking for a 4k streamer and was trying to decide between the Roku 4 or this. I had recently ditched my cable and got Playstation Vue for my programming and this allows shows to stream at 60fps. If you get this I also strongly suggest cutting your cable cord and getting Playstation Vue also because this streams sports better than any of the others,positive

6942,5.0,This download movies fast and quick. You get a good picture when using the fire tv because you have to use your hdmi wire,positive
6943,5.0,Works great. Less buffering than Fire TV Stick. Like the voice search on it.,positive
6944,3.0,"I got this to use while I travel because you can connect to Wi-Fi that has a webpage for signing in, like pretty much all hotels require. It was awesome for about two weeks. At first it worked fine with my brand new awesome Samsung 4k tv, then a week later the tv didn't even recognize it. Apparently it doesn't pay nice with Samsung. Not a huge deal since I bought it for traveling, then it didn't display correctly on the hotel tv, it was just a tiny piece of the picture and it was jammed into the top corner and the rest black. The next hotel, it looked fine but there wasn't any audio. COME ON. Really stinks.",negative
6945,5.0,I was really surprised how easy it was to use and set up. I may be looking to add one in my man cave and bedroom too! Great device,positive
6946,5.0,Great device for streaming video. You can side load Kodi and different add-ons to get movies and TV shows for free.,positive

6948,3.0,"It's okay. When hooked up to my tv wirelessly, there seems to be a lot of lag. Seems to work better hard wired.",negative
6949,5.0,"At first, I was kind of worried that I would not be able to operate it. But it is so easy to use! I also like the parental controls, so I can control what my children watch. The best part of all though is that I don't have to see any infomercials! My family and myself have definitely enjoyed having this product in our home. We have yet to run out of programs and movies to watch!",positive
6950,5.0,"I had the firestick first so I decided to upgrade my new TV with a fireTV and I haven't had any issues it's so easy to use runs way smoother than my firestick, and I love that I can upload storage with my micro SD card.",positive

6954,4.0,"I bought this strictly for the streaming 4K content from Netflix. Not sure if this happened to others, but season 2 of HOC would never stream correctly in 4K. The other seasons worked just fine. Also, HOC looks very very good just on HD 5.1.",positive

6957,5.0,Great for intertainment very good device effective better than cable Tv,positive
6958,5.0,"One of the best streaming devices available currently especially for the cost. The app store gives you access to all the major streaming services - Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, etc. The only knock on it is that it places heavy focus on Amazon Prime videos for obvious reason. As a side benefit (pun intended) - you can put SPMC/Kodi/XBMC on it like I have and combined with a HDHOMERUN it is now a cable box replacement. It is the only box I have plugged into my TV and use it for Live TV, DVR, Movies, Videos, Pictures, and all the streaming apps. Powerful little unit that saves on electricity and space compared to HTPC that was hooked up before. No more monthly cable box rental fee's so it pays for itself in a few months.",positive
6959,5.0,I have the stick also much better than the stick one...,positive
6960,5.0,The best item I have ever seen in my life and so glad I found this item....:),positive
6961,4.0,You are streaming over the net so occasionally this will cause some inconvenience but all in all 98% of the time you can utilize this device just as if you had cable or satellite. Time to cut the cord and stopping paying these outlandish supped up prices.,positive
6962,5.0,reception and wi fi interface is outstanding much better than roku,positive
6963,5.0,I cut the cord with cable and decided to try the Amazon Fire tv and it is amazing. Amazon Fire tv is the only box to offer basically all services. I did a lot of research and I am glad I went with this box!,positive

6970,5.0,"Has a great processor for its size, it's robust with lots of features and has a wonderful small remote that fits nicely in your hand. The remote has much fewer buttons then your standard remotes, which makes its very simply to use and along with Amazon GUI interface makes its simple to get around. I had other products that it competes with and this is by far the best, easier device to get around with.",positive

6986,5.0,The Fire Stick and TV is awesome. Fire TV is a lot faster and it has the option of ether net. I love it.,positive
6987,5.0,It basically makes any old TV a smart tv. It is also 4K UHD. That is one of the biggest pluses on top of me having Amazon Prime already.,positive
6988,5.0,"I was streaming with my Sony Blu-Ray, and only bought this to access HBO Now, but it's turned out to have much more than just that to offer. It's really a fantastic piece of equipment. The Sony has a great number of streaming apps, but the Fire TV has much more, and lots of things I really missed, such as PBS and PBS Kids, as well as access to Amazon's music streaming. I'm very happy that I bought this.",positive
6989,5.0,"Of the three streaming boxes i have owned this one is hands down the best. I added Playstation Vue app and now i get 59 cable channels. Prime movies, music, and TV is awesome.",positive
6990,5.0,I'm a cable cutter and Amazon Fire TV has been a God send. I have more content now than with cable. Highly recommend this producg.,positive
6991,5.0,We decided to cut our cable bill and start using streaming devices instead. The Fire has been great. The only problem is finding time to watch all the stuff we put in our watch list.,positive
6992,5.0,Well worth the upgrade from the Amazon Fire stick... It is definately a lot faster and smoother.,positive

7009,4.0,"All your services in one place. UI takes a little getting used to, but becomes 2nd nature.",positive
7010,5.0,Bought this to streaming media in HD and 4K and it works great. Only bad thing is you need a high speed HDMI to be able to streaming in 4k.,positive
7011,5.0,"I have a bunch of sticks but to be honest, I like the box better. Runs much faster and less buffering",positive
7012,3.0,"We're an unplugged family - multiple devices (Kindles, iPads, Roku, etc.) - so we're pretty familiar with this sort of tech. Fire TV works okay, but the remote has started giving me problems and we've only had the product for about 6 months. Our Roku 3, which we've had for over a year, is much smoother and hasn't given us any problems. We also use a Chromecast, which also seems to be less quirky than the FireTV. I have a PS3 in the same room as the FireTV and I find myself going to the PS3 when the FireTV starts to annoy. Unless you're looking for a device that can also run Kodi, I'd strongly recommend the Roku 3 over the FireTV.",negative
7013,5.0,I bought this to utilize playstaion vue to cut my cable. works great,positive
7014,5.0,"If you are looking to add smart TV capabilities to your TV (or replace existing smart TV capabilities), this is the product to own! In my opinion Amazon knocked it out of the park with this streamer. Paired with a 4K TV, it adds amazing clarity to 4K Content!",positive
7015,5.0,I love my Roku but the Amazon Fire TV is the box to own and the price is right.,positive
7016,5.0,If is the easy to set up and use ...Got everything I wanted and more the speed of the tv box is great !!!,positive
7017,5.0,Amazing item that everyone in the whole family enjoys.,positive
7018,5.0,"This has allowed me to cut that nasty cable cord, which is nice to the check book.",positive
7019,4.0,"The box works great it is compact, easy to install and all around easy to navigate. The only reason I did not give the full star rating is that my remote keeps giving out. It will work most the time then it will just stopped I have replaced the batteries. That's not the issue I actually have to take the batteries out and put them back in to some times get the remote working again. I am hoping getting the remote replaced will be easy and hassle free",positive
7020,5.0,This is a very good product with good performance and value.,positive
7021,4.0,Does exactly what it is supposed to. 5 stars if it were a little less $$ and had bitstream audio out for true dolby atmos decoding on the receiver end.,positive

7025,5.0,Great little streaming device. Mainly use for Netflix and Playstation Vue,positive
7026,5.0,"This is my second Amazon Fire TV. I like both first and second versions of the AFTV, unless your programming is broadcast in 4K, you won't notice the picture quality of the two versions. It has all the Apps you will need and available to sideload if it's not available thru Amazon. Voice command only works with downloaded Apps. Overall, I like AFTV over 3rd Gen Apple TV....",positive
7027,5.0,Very great product very great product very great product,positive
7028,5.0,Still the best streaming device for kodi Works flawless,positive
7029,5.0,"Amazon Fire tv from Best Buy was my second Fire tv purchase in a week. After trying the tv service, I ordered a 2nd one on line from Best Buy & picked it up in store within an hour. The price matched the 1st one but the HDMI cable was extra. When I am used to using Fire tv, I will turn the cable service off. Amazon's Alexa assistant is phenomenal & for me, is better than Apple's Siri. This was probably the best online purchase & pick up in store experience I have had.",positive
7030,4.0,Very happy with this product. I would recommend for anyone,positive
7031,5.0,"This is great for the entire family! Love this device to watch shows, movies and even play games!",positive

7033,5.0,My Amazon TV has two gig in the ram and a quad core processor and it runs great no problems right now only owned it for six weeks right now but it's good,positive
7034,5.0,"Better than the firestick, works well with prime and simple to use.",positive
7035,5.0,"The Amazon Fire TV box is probably the best streaming box out there. It has a hardwired Ethernet connection if you need it and a fast processor. It has Alexa for voice searches and it supports just about every streaming service out there plus a built-in Slingbox client. Most other streamers that support slingbox are actually screencasting from a smartphone or tablet. Plus it is very easy to sideload applications so you can run about anything. We have crowded building with a lot of WiFi signals stepping on each other, so the hardwired connection is good for reliable streaming. It has Bluetooth, so you can pair devices with it, I think the remote is actually Bluetooth too, so you can stash the box out of sight.",positive
7036,5.0,Great product for online streaming. Way better than cable,positive
7037,5.0,This product works great. It was very easy to. Setup and get an account going I would recommend the fire tv to everyone that wants to cut the cord from cable. It was cheaper to purchase it at Best Buy then it was on Amazon,positive

7039,5.0,Great gift for family and friends. I would recommend to my friends.,positive
7040,5.0,"I love my Amazon fire tv!! Use it with Playstation Vue, perfect device to cut the cord!!",positive
7041,5.0,I purchased this in order to stream Playstation Vue. It works very well for this. Amazon also offers 4K content - one of the few places you can get it for now.,positive
7042,5.0,"Amazon Fire tv is the best ""smart tv box"" available. The box is now 4K video capable and uses the android operating system. Plenty of apps already installed and tons more available. Setup was simple and the menus are a breeze to navigate, especially with voice search.",positive
7043,5.0,"Able to watch so many movies, Netflix and get access to more than just the normal cable offsprings.",positive
7044,4.0,I purchased this item to cancel my cable tv and use PlayStation Vue for the television channels like SyFy and others. The network connection allows the use the high speed internet without bogging done the Wifi. The only issue I have encountered is the remote can be laggy but it has less lag that the fire tv stick remotes.,positive
7045,4.0,"Works well, gives a to of additional options for home television entertainment for everyone.",positive
7046,5.0,This was a nice edition to my entertainment add ons. Makes watching tv more of a pleasure. The price wasn't that bad either.,positive

7048,5.0,I do not use my Apple tvs anymore. Great for PS Vue and Prime.,positive

7053,5.0,"To be honest, I think the Fire TV is a way better investment than Apple TV. Highly recommended!",positive
7054,3.0,"I got this because I didn't want to set another cable box in my room. I don't watch a lot of tv to begin with. What I like about the fire tv is that you can download apps such as the Uverse app from att and watch live tv from it. And other apps like history channel, Netflix, food channel. You can also buy an app that lets you connect your smart phone to the tv. So if you have a movie on your phone or laptop that the fire tv doesn't have, you can connect it and mirror it and it will appear on your tv. Almost as having a cable box but you only pay once and not every month for it. The control does get disconnected a lot, I don't know if it's the Amazon batteries or if it's the remote. Over its good for someone who doesn't watch a lot of tv.",negative
7055,5.0,Easy to setup and use. The content is very clear. Connect to wireless or Ethernet and off to the races.,positive
7056,5.0,Absolutely worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive

7062,5.0,This device is easy to install and great for a beginner!,positive
7063,5.0,"Great product that is easy to install and setup. It does not come with an HDMI cable so be sure to have one handy. On a side note, your email with get spam continuously with Amazon Advertisement to be sure to unsubscribe as soon as you can.",positive
7064,5.0,We are happy with purchasing the Amazon Fire. Very easy to use and don't know what we watched without it.,positive
7065,5.0,"Amazon Fire TV is so much better than cable or satellite TV. If you have a good internet connection, this is the best!",positive
7066,5.0,Cut the cord with DirecTV and so happy that I did. Lots of content to watch and crystal clear. Quality Streaming & Sound. Thanks Bezos.,positive
7067,5.0,"Happy The Fire TV, Have had no issues, Like another way to use Alexa.",positive
7068,5.0,Had bought 2 Fire sticks and decided to get the fire tv box to get more space to download movies and games.,positive
7069,3.0,Gives access to all streaming apps & doesn't seem too slow as far as responsiveness. Much better than the AF Stick. Haven't had any issues.,negative
7070,5.0,Apple TV is going to do better than it currently is to keep up with Amazon Fire. So much more freedom with this little black box.,positive
7071,5.0,"I own a Chromecast and didn't think I would need this. How wrong I was! The Amazon Fire TV box is more functional and useful than the Chromecast. It is easy to travel with and as long as you have a solid Internet connection (wired or wireless), you can enjoy this device. This was a great purchase and I highly recommend it! So nice I bought it twice!",positive
7072,1.0,it is not free everything . have to pay and had return it to best buy store . wish free everything without cents . sorry,negative
7073,4.0,everyone in the family can use it and find something they want to watch or do on this,positive
7074,5.0,Easy to use and no buffering issues. Works better on wifi than cable,positive
7075,5.0,This is my third one I have in my house. We love the ease of use and compatibility with all our online services. Works great. Never had an issue with any of them.,positive
7076,4.0,I originally purchased the Amazon fire stick which I did not like at all! it was very slow and it didn't stream Netflix well. I returned the fire stick in exchange for the Amazon fire TV and holy cow what a difference. Everything streams so quickly and it works tremendously well with Wi-Fi. Only bad thing is you have to restart it from time to time to refresh the system.,positive
7077,5.0,Since purchasing this product I rarely ever watch live tv anymore. It does exactly what I wanted it to.,positive
7078,4.0,"ask yourself if you want a chromcast for 1/3 the cost of this device or do you want to up to PS4 and pretty much get all the features this has and a gaming platform. Then again, you can tweak this system with after market software which you can't on the other two. If you like amazon, are on a budget and have prime, might as well go deeper into the amazon ecosphere.",positive
7079,5.0,I love everything about my fire tv. I wish I wouldve gotten one sooner!,positive
7080,5.0,"Totally love this product, definitely makes time pass by faster and can take it anywhere",positive
7081,5.0,"This will be your simple answer: yes, this will fulfill ALL of your cable cutting desires.I purchased this product after reading several reviews online, researching the specifications between this Amazon Fire TV and the Fire Stick (and their respective generations), and I planned my attack on making sure I fully cut away from the monopoly that is Cable/Satellite television today.Wow, not only did this completely replace my cable subscription with a company that rhymes with AP&P, but I was welcomed into an entirely new world of entertainment once I had this device up and running the way I wanted to. Which, by the way, the setup and installation is an absolute breeze, no need for installation manuals, guides, etc.Buy this, cut away from your overpriced cable, and get to entertaining yourself right now!",positive
7082,5.0,The 4k is pretty nice and they response time is nice. Wife uses this mostly. Haven't heard any negative comments yet. Got it to use for PlayStation vue.,positive

7086,5.0,I'm really enjoying my Amazon FireTv. It's everything I though it would be.,positive
7087,5.0,I love the Fire TV Box it works flawlessly. I recommend adding the Spotify App. It makes all your sorround sound Bluetooth. Worth every penny for sure . Don't think about it just buy it .,positive
7088,3.0,"The product works well except the WiFi drops every so often. Restart the firetv and it's fine. Also, the remote will sometimes not work. Pull batteries and put them back in fixes it. Kind of sad for such problems cuz I love the firetv.",negative
7089,5.0,I would recommend it to all my family very happy with this item.,positive
7090,1.0,"Everything I had read was a bit confusing on how the Echo can control it.. but low and behold it has the Alexa service built into it. The Echo CANNOT control the Amazon Fire TV which was the sole reason I bought it. Well.. also in hopes that HBO Now would have Surround Sound on it, but of course it didn't. So they're both at fault here and the reason why I returned it immediately. Since neither of the above worked, this made the device completely redundant with my Chromecast.",negative
7091,5.0,Installed the Kodi program on this & it works better then Netflix - I get to watch the latest shows for FREE.,positive
7092,5.0,I used to have the first generation of Fire TV. Love it. This is the 2nd generation and 4 k ready. Even better,positive
7093,5.0,Love this.. Would buy so many times if I had more tvs,positive
7094,5.0,Easy to set up had all the channels I felt it was less clunky than roku,positive
7095,4.0,"I have used several different streaming players/devices including the Amazon Fire TV stick and others like the Google Chromecast. I liked the Fire TV sticks but I am basically impressed with the Fire TV unit. The extra connections and microSd slot are a big plus. I also really like the voice remote. I have Kodi TV installed as well and it makes playing videos/music and viewing pictures via my home network incredibly easy. The interface is also nice looking. Overall, I am very pleased with the unit. I bought one for my 4K TV and it streams 4K content very well. It only goes to 4K mode when the UHD stream is actually playing though and stays at full HD most of the time. I liked it enough that I bought another one of my home theater room as well. I definitely recommend these units to others.",positive
7096,5.0,"I had the Fire Stick prior to purchasing the Fire TV and it is night and day. Fire TV is much faster and has larger buffer, there is no lag in response time while watching TV thru Fire TV. Very happy with this purchase.",positive
7097,4.0,"it is a great streaming device with all the apps you need for streaming whatever it is you watch, cut the cable go to streaming it will save a lot of money",positive
7098,4.0,Excellent except for the fact that after it automatically goes into sleep mode after thirty minutes of non-activity it is difficult to wake up.,positive
7099,1.0,This item is the worst ever a d the tech support is even worst. Spent hour troubleshooting and their solution was to return it to Bestbuy a d get anotherone. So i did. And guess what? It didn't work ether. Basically the Netflix app can't be downloaded becuse the Amazon Fire tv won't let you and to make it worst if you're a fan of HBO brace yourself becuase the app isn't even available on their app store. HBO simply doesn't exist. I spent in total 4 days troubleshooting with the Amazon team actually managing the Fire TV remotely from their offices and the answer was that ether the equipment is defective or that they don't have Netflix or HBO available for it. REALLY ITS FREAKING ADVERTISED ON THE BOX. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY. better get an apple tv or a roku,negative
7100,4.0,Best feature I like is that it plays in 4K.Apple tv does not,positive
7101,5.0,It is very kid friendly. It was very easy to use at home.,positive
7102,5.0,"Very easy to set up and operate. The voice command is especially nice when playing music and so far I've found the music library to be quite large with a good selection. If you use Amazon at all I would recommend the Prime membership as it pays for itself quickly and drastically increases the available content in the media libraries. No, I'm not an Amazon employee :)",positive
7103,5.0,"After purchasing a smart tv looking forward to using the built in apps I discovered that the ones offered weren't up to par. I went back and talked to a very knowledgeable associate, Heather, she showed me why i was having trouble with the streaming on my new tv and suggested getting a streaming device. After listening to her explain the differences between them I decided on the Amazon Fire TV and she was spot on. No more issues and the speed and picture are great. Thanks so much Heather.",positive

7117,4.0,"Works well. It was easy to set up. My only complaint is that it's a hassle to load applications that don't come with it. I loaded Xfinity to go on it, and it was very difficult to use, as it doesn't fit the screen right. Great idea, too many glitches with new software. I would recommend getting a mini bluetooth keyboard. It was easy to connect, and works well with this.",positive

7131,4.0,"Fire TV is good except I have to reboot it more than should be necessary. It drops its network connection too often. Rather than reentering my password, I find it easier to just unplug it for a few seconds. Once, the remote became unresponsive . The fix: remove the batteries then put them right back in. Updates should correct these matters.",positive
7132,5.0,Love it it works wonders great job greate product.will recommend to any friend,positive

7148,5.0,"I've been using both Roku (embedded into LG TV) and the Amazon Fire Tv. The true winner is the Amazon Fire TV since it always works, very fast, as expected, no issues, no bugs. The Roku instead is slower (takes time to react and load content). I mainly use Netflix and YouTube. Amazon Fire TV delivers outstanding menu navigation and fast response while searching/navigating through content (movies, tv shows, videos). Also Amazon Fire TV is always on and ready and you can take advantage of Alexa to use your voice to command (useful from time to time).",positive

7209,5.0,This keyboard does it all for the beginner or for the professional. The keys have a real piano feel with some resistance. The speakers are amazing. The choice of instrument sounds are outstanding and the tone of those instruments are right on.,positive
7210,5.0,I started our with just the Fire Stick at home. Once I purchased a 4k TV I decided to splurge on the Fire TV. I'm so glad I did the one thing that annoyed me about the stick was relying on WiFi stability and now I've ran an ether net straight to my router so problem solved.,positive

7219,3.0,"Although I had a Roku three that did most of what I needed, Playstation Vue isn't available but it is available on the Fire TV. If you have a prime membership, this is probably for you. If you are one of the people that don't like me, this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them. You can't set the menu's to only show the content that you own and the apps that you have downloaded can't be put first on the list.",negative

7267,5.0,"This is a great product. I downloaded tv apps like directv, HBO go, tnt, ESPN, etc. then I take it where ever I go, as long as I can get wifi, I won't miss a show or a movie. Fire stick is a little more travel friendly but this is faster between clicking on screens and had more internal memory (with option to add sdhc card)",positive

7272,5.0,If you've an Amazon prime account this is a must have. Lots of free shows and movies to watch and lots of apps to download.

7275,5.0,"For the same price as the Roku 3, you can get the Amazon Fire TV box. Why would you want this? 1. It runs Android2. You can install Android Apps (via sideload)3. It's Extensible. Because of items 1 and 2, you can really make this any kind of device you want. Most Android apps should work on this, and of course, you have access to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc.",positive
7276,5.0,"I enjoy moving night, and it kept becoming a hassle deciding what movies to watch, or what medium I would need to rent them. With the firestick, you have all the movies and shows at your disposal, which makes my life so much easier. What a great find. I am glad word of mouth helped me find this product, and would recommend it to anyone.",positive
7277,5.0,"It's a great delivery vehicle for all your Amazon video and music needs. I bought it to watch PlayStation Vue (no more expensive Time Warner Cable for me!) It's built on Android OS so you can install Andriod apps. What I love about this box is that I can load my old school NES and SNES emulators and play them with the Bluetooth controller. You can also set up Kodi on it and you've got all kinds of movie, TV, music and gaming options using it. With micro SD card support and an extra USB port, this device is so much better than the TV Stick, and it's a lot speedier. Highly recommended!",positive
7278,5.0,"Great product clear video stream, very easy to hook up",positive
7279,4.0,The new Fire TV has every streaming option that you can think of except VUDU. This is the only negative that we have found because we have over 100 digital copies of movies that have been either purchased or came with the blue-ray when we bought them. It is very convenient to not have to use the disc when we want to watch a movie. The Fire TV loses that convenience in that Amazon wants you to use their Prime service for digital movies. If you are going to subscribe to Amazon Prime then look no further than the Fire TV. If you have a large digital movie collection then I'd look to the Roku 4.,positive
7280,5.0,This is the 5th or 6th Fire TV I have purchased. Now I have them in every room and have completely cancelled cable. Just pay $60 a month for internet now and use my Fire TV's with the Zeus TV Box program downloaded. Now I get all the movies and tv shows I want for free. And the Fire TV has super fast download speeds. Will be buying more for the family this year.,positive

7291,5.0,"Did a good bit of research for the fire tv. Bought the stick first, had several operating issues. Unit would buffer then freeze up. The unit got real hot. Returned the stick for the fire tv box. Have not had any of the same problems. Saving over $100 a month cutting out cable. So paid for itself, definitely a great decision.",positive
7292,5.0,I purchased this for my father. He likes to watch movies and this was the best way for me to send him movies because he Ives out of town. Great product!!!,positive
7293,4.0,Like the fact that this unit now includes Alexa. Hope that more Apps are available soon (seems Roku has a few that this one doesn't).,positive
7294,4.0,"Our family enjoys our Amazon tv box, it's great expecially with the free movies and TV shows. I like the remote design better than the apple tv box, but that's just my opinion. It's a great addition to any tv because it makes searching and watching whatever you want effortless.",positive
7295,5.0,We first purchased the stick and worked great but we wanted something more powerful. This allowed us to connect directly to our router and got great connection. No more pauses or buffering. I would buy again if I needed to.,positive
7296,5.0,This makes tv more fun easy setup just plug and play.,positive
7297,5.0,I use this everyday. It's a great buy. Everything you need is ready to go as soon as it turned on.,positive
7298,5.0,This product is our first of its kind to own. It has a lot of entertainment optikns.,positive
7299,5.0,"I have a Chromecast and Apple TV, but have not used them since I bought this device. An absolute must - especially if you have Amazon Prime!",positive
7300,5.0,The amazon fire tv is amazing. Small portable yet powerful and good quality. It is also structured well so things are easy to find.,positive
7301,5.0,The Fire TV is an awesome device. Great for Netflix and Hulu streaming.,positive

7304,3.0,"It works well when I use it everyday. However, it does not turn on when I do not use it for a few days. I pull out its power code and then it works again. I am not sure if I better to ask to replace it.",negative
7305,5.0,The Amazon fire tv is plug and play. Very easy to use,positive

7309,5.0,This thing has everything you need to watch movies and shows in 4K. I watch it almost everyday.,positive
7310,5.0,I own both a Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick. The Amazon Fire TV is by far superior than the Fire Stick. The Fire TV is perfect for all-in-one entertainment and perfect if you're looking to get rid of cable/satellite tv. Also very ideal for Kodi,positive
7311,5.0,"The Fire Tv is fast and reliable. With the ease of setup and expandability of this product, it's a no brainer BUY!",positive
7312,5.0,We enjoy using the fire tv. Since we are prime members we also get free movies,positive
7313,5.0,Good device.. Easy to set up. You could stream anything u want basically,positive
7314,5.0,"I couldn't be happier with Amazon Fire TV! I had purchased the Fire stick first to try out. It, as well as Fire TV, are a breeze to install...fast, easy, and amazing. I have the voice remotes on all of them and it makes navigating outstanding. I'm using the Fire Stick on my bedroom TV and the Fire TV on my flat screen in the family room. The main difference is that the Fire TV has a greater memory capacity than the Stick. It comes with a lot of free films, programs, games (unlike the other streaming services), music for Prime members. The options available to kids (from toddlers to grade schoolers), are incredible and include both games and videos. It allows you to keep a personal ""Watchlist"" for those things that are you faves or that you want to come back to at a later date. There's so much available with this that I can't say enough about it. It also has all the subscription services that you can test with the free trials that they offer: Sling, Hulu, HBO, Starz, and much, much more. That way, if you're really looking to cut the cable, you get a great feel as to what's out there and how much it will cost should you pick a paid service. Even if you just stick with what Amazon offers freely (and they add things all the time) you still would only be paying for the Fire TV and nothing more. Definitely a win/win for those who are fed up with being gouged over and over by digital services. With this, all you'll need is wifi, and a TV with HDMI ports....and you'll be good to go.",positive
7315,5.0,"Love it , so easy to use and you can easily just talk to the control",positive
7316,5.0,It's very fast and it's very well made I really like the style of the box it's not bulky like the other boxes out there,positive
7317,5.0,The fire tv box simply does it all. Very fast and fun to use,positive
7318,5.0,I love my fire TV. I use it mainly for watching movies and TV shows. We also use it for Pandora listening to music. You can also side load applications that aren't available directly through the App Store. I cut the cable cord and haven't looked back!,positive
7319,5.0,"the fire tv box is very very fast and has all the TV streaming apps you need to ""cut the cord"". Other streamers like apple tv or roku are not as fast or have all the apps i like. Just avoid the fire tv stick...too slow.",positive
7320,5.0,Great streaming device based on Android which makes it somewhat customizable.,positive
7321,5.0,Great item for watching all new and old movies and or tv shows.,positive
7322,5.0,Awesome products friendly staff would defiantly do business again,positive
7323,5.0,"Love it!!! works very well.. I already had amazon prime service and was loving it for fast delivery and no shipping charges... Now, i am getting more bonus out of Prime for using Fire TV!!! works great. some of apps do not work very well. but, that's the app. most of app works fine. I am sure people will continue to fall in love with amazon TV and App will continue to improve.",positive
7324,5.0,"My son was the first in the family to buy it. Then he introduced it to me, to his sisters and now we all having a great time enjoying the little box.",positive

7329,5.0,Very good picture quality. Performs as advertised and worth the prize paid for.,positive
7330,5.0,I've cancelled my cable. Best purchase I've made in a long time. The picture quality is amazing.,positive
7331,5.0,The best purchase I have made in years. Wish I would have done it sooner,positive
7332,4.0,Purchased this to test it out. I have a prime membership. The interface seems a little slow and not as intuitive as other streaming players however do like the 4K capability for the price,positive
7333,5.0,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because I wanted to be able to watch Sony Vue in the bedroom without having to get another Playstation console. We have an Apple TV (newer model), and I like it a lot too, but the Fire TV allows me to watch both Amazon Prime content and the Sony Vue channels, which I can't on my Apple TV. The Amazon Fire TV is very responsive, has great Apps, it is lightweight and doesn't take up much room. In fact, we have it hanging in the back of our TV which is mounted to the wall, and you can't even see it. I highly recommend it.",positive
7334,5.0,"don't have a smart tv, so this fire tv is perfect for downloading Netflix, vudu, and any other apps. a must for tv watchers",positive
7335,4.0,"The Fire TV is much faster than the Fire Stick. It's super-compact. It has a better antenna, so it can pick up the wifi signal from farther away than the fire stick. It also supports 4K streaming and has more memory than the fire stick (this means gaming capability). The only downsides are: you must sign in/create an Amazon account (which is free), it doesn't come with an HDMI cord (which is required for use), and it doesn't have expandable memory. Overall, it is well worth the price and I would suggest spending the extra $60 and purchasing the Fire TV instead of the Fire Stick.",positive
7336,4.0,Most tv's come with all the viewing apps you need but they're not portable. FireTV has everything you want plus it fits neatly in your suitcase.,positive
7337,5.0,"Great product, I bought one last year and loved it. Had to buy another for the guest room. Having Alexa makes it even easier to use.",positive
7338,5.0,"We bought the box to see if it would make sense to dump cable. The ease of use is one sell, but the fact I can watch anything and not worry about junk sold it for me.",positive
7339,5.0,"This product works better than the smart tv function of our current tv, simplifies the process and especially the search function. no more clicking and scrolling thru the alphabet...just speak it and let it search for you - that alone is worth the $",positive
7340,5.0,It was everything I expected it to be. Very pleased. I would recommend this product and your store to everyone I know.,positive
7341,5.0,i really rely on this product . I watch movies and and lots of Tv Shows.i would really recommend this product to everyone.,positive

7349,5.0,"This is a great product with many options for movies, games, music and much much more",positive
7350,5.0,"Most people buy this for use with Amazon Prime, but that isn't absolutely necessary as there are many other useful apps that are available.",positive
7351,5.0,The product was easy to setup and use. I really like it.,positive
7352,5.0,"Works great IMO altho when I first got it home the remote didn't work and appeared corroded insidewe called the store and they said I had to call some parts store, which said they were out of remotesKind of a run around IMO I got the remote fixed myself Other than that the box works grest",positive
7353,5.0,I purchased the Amazon Fire because you can get the PS Vue app. The system is easy to use and the picture quality is great.,positive
7354,3.0,"I purchased this box in hopes of using it for the new Playstation Vue service which it did run pretty well. It does everything they say it does but one of the main issues I had with the original and still have with this is the interface. The layout for the main screen and the ads they throw in your face are just ridiculous. After using Roku for years, the Nvidia Shield TV, and the new Apple TV I would recommend any of those over this device any day. They offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part (except playstation vue).",negative
7355,4.0,Great little device to save money. Streams live and on demand TV. Great way to save money on TV subscriptions,positive
7356,5.0,"I use this device to collaborate all my entertained needs. Amazon Prime, Netflix, Plex, etc.",positive
7357,3.0,"Love it, but at times it just goes black. I have to unplug and hook back up order for it to work, sometimes multiple times. Same with the reg fire stick that i have on anther TV.",negative

7361,5.0,Better than fire stick a lot faster loading lots of movies and games great product,positive
7362,4.0,"Just purchased to replace my regular firestick. The system runs faster, better processor. It can handle the games alot better then the firestick. The voice remote is a cool add on. If you dont play games i wouldnt really reccomend upgrading to the fire tv box, just get the firestick. Hdmi and router cable arent included. The wifi actually worked better then when it was plugged in. Not sure why. Good purchase..I would recomend this over the chromecast or apple tv anyday.",positive
7363,4.0,"It's the amazon version of AppleTv. I guess I expected something a little more ""wow"" for the cost, but it looks like amazon's app on my xbox and smart tv. Not anything super special. It works as intended though and not really any problems. The remote feels flimsy compared to the aluminum of the apple tv gen 1-3",positive
7364,5.0,Easy to use and work great with amzn prime. Lots of flexibility. Not as slick as Apple TV but at half the price a great value,positive
7365,5.0,These are the best you can get! I have bought 2 already,positive
7366,5.0,"Look no further excellent streaming device, great processor , good ram , expandable storage , also supports 4k what else could you ask for",positive

7371,4.0,"We love the fire TV stick, got one for each TV and got rid of cable. Subscribed to PlayStation Vue instead. However we had to get a new Blackhawk router because we were constantly streaming, before that the TV was buffering tons. Works great now.",positive
7372,5.0,Once you get the Amazon box you don't need to pay for cable again!,positive
7373,5.0,"Works great with Kodi, enough power to direct play h265. SD card slot is a bonus for apps and USB for external media. Threw my Roku away.",positive
7374,5.0,At the price pout you will not find a better product!,positive
7375,5.0,"Great Streaming tool, I own this and the the firestick. Have been able to cut the cord finally",positive
7376,5.0,Easy to set up. Availability of service is great. Enjoy the selections.,positive
7377,5.0,"I purchased this when I cut cable since at the time it was the only device that had a Sony Playstation Vue App. Although Roku added this channel almost immediately after I purchased the Fire TV, the user interface for Vue is better on the Fire TV. Roku has more apps / channels. However, Fire TV is still a decent compliment and the 4K capability makes this a viable option. Speed and performance is good.",positive
7378,5.0,Features that i never thought I would be interested.,positive
7379,4.0,"Compared to Dish Prices, this is a good option. It allows you to customize TV stations to a degree. It has the potential to replace dish in the long run if you have an internet connection.",positive
7380,4.0,Perfect for my busy family. We can all watch shows and without having to watch them the day they run. Lots of extras and easy to use.,positive
7381,5.0,"I own a couple FireSticks and decided to give the Fire Tv a try. I'm glad I did because you can tell the difference right out of the box. Not that there is anything wrong at all with the stick, but the smooth speed and response is a welcomed attribute to my most used television.",positive
7382,5.0,"Amazon Fire tv is just an amazing addition to your tv. Even if you have a smart tv, the ability to add so many more apps than your smart tv platform provides is great. Very customizable. Love it!",positive
7383,4.0,"I use it frequently and have enjoyed watching shows. I would have given it a perfect score, but not all of my shows are on it.",positive
7384,5.0,We bought this to replace a Roku 3 that had died. This is an excellent streaming device! It has roughly the same specs as a Roku 4 but is much less expensive. I definitely recommend this!,positive
7385,5.0,I'm very happy with this. It's easy to use and I'd recommend this.,positive
7386,5.0,"Love it!! I installed a app that allows me to watch almost every movie and tv show for free! Never have any problems with it and works really well, if you can't afford cable or direct tv this would be the next best thing to do but you do need the internet for it to work.",positive

7389,2.0,"I purchased this device to stream movies to a room that had minimal apps. The I tried to activate Netflix, I kept getting an error on log-in. Then after contacting Amazon Tech help & researching found out that Amazon & Netflix parted ways and do not support each other. So, I returned the device and purchased the Roku4 instead to great satisfaction.",negative
7390,5.0,This product is wonderful. If your looking for a way to get rid of cable this is the way to go.,positive
7391,5.0,"Great product, very easy to apply and I LOVE IT :)",positive
7392,5.0,"Decided to try the Amazon Fire to replace our cable TV. Since I'm already an Amazon Prime member for other reasons, this was only a one-time expense for me. It was a very good choice - the Amazon Fire has given me the flexibility to watch what I want to watch and when without having to record and monitor what I record on the DVR. With the Amazon Fire I'm in control and not the cable company Even with adding Hulu & Sling, I'm still saving $100 each month!",positive
7393,4.0,"Love the blue tooth remote, does freeze up from time to time",positive
7394,4.0,I love it!! I would definately refer my friends and family to buy one for their TV's also,positive
7395,5.0,"Easy setup, fast.Had everything ROKU has plus games.",positive
7396,5.0,"Got this to replace a Roku. Similar content but more features and a seems bit faster. Only knock is minor: could be a bit more customizable. But overall an excellent, sleek interface.",positive
7397,5.0,"I love it ! I use it every day for music, movies, and current events. The voice command remote is awesome. Cant wait to buy the video game controller for it to play first Gen. Nintendo games",positive
7398,5.0,"If you are a Amazon Prime or PlayStation Vue member, this is a must buy. Easy to use connect. Simple log in. Intuitive guide. Small, but not too small. Great remote. Relatively inexpensive. 4k qualityOnly wish I could transfer remote features to my Logitech remote.",positive

7405,5.0,"They have so much stuff that I am not sure where to start. Its fast, reliable, and easy to set up. I have the yearly Amazom Prime membership and it includes their tv service and also their music app with no ads. A must have if your into watching a lot of tv like myself.",positive
7406,4.0,Very smooth and easy to use. I would buy another..,positive
7407,5.0,Great product!!!! Would totally recommend it to anyone!!!,positive
7408,2.0,I had a hard time trying to stream movies even with a good internet connection ....was a little disappointed,negative
7409,5.0,"Although I did like the Roku navigation a little better, the Amazon Fire TV has given us everything we need to feel good about not having cable anymore. We started with one and have gone back to buy 2 more.",positive
7410,4.0,Fire tv is great no problems at all the best purchase I've made this year,positive
7411,4.0,"Expandable memory option was a big plus, 4k video output when streaming video is great and I was able to load programs to watch free movies and ppv.",positive

7416,5.0,Works like a charm and am Bert pleased with my purchase,positive
7417,5.0,"I may be slow to catch on to ""streaming."" I was unaware of the depth of available media material. Things to consider are Internet download speed (30 Mbs minimum) and too many choices. It is similar to the Internet before the World Wide Web (www). Some Android apps such as Kodi with Fire TV Guru make some of the material more easily accessible. Good luck!",positive
7418,4.0,"Easy setup , when you install very very easy, good",positive
7419,4.0,My family loves the firetv. The only thing we had to do was upgrade our Internet speed.,positive
7420,4.0,I really love both Amazon tv and Apple TV as products. I do wish Amazon tv has a simplified AirPlay ability for iOS. I'm sure with apps you buy and other methods you can accomplish it but if it was just standard like Apple TV AirPlay I would give this product 5 stars. For cheap easy price it makes a great gift. Where it beats Apple TV is 4 k streaming. So if you want 4K get Amazon Fire tv.,positive
7421,5.0,"Didn't compare to the fire stick, unknown if better product, but love amazons creation",positive
7422,5.0,great results with this product. it is easy to use and exactly what I expected it to be.,positive
7423,5.0,I gave this Amazon fire stick as a Father's Day present. So i am not a personal user of the product but have heard it was nice.,positive
7424,3.0,"It is ok for the average user. But it os not good enough for Kodi. The interface is ok, but a little too busy for me. I did not like the fact that I could not use my universal Harmony remote with it. Jodi also takes almost an hour to set up and it buffers way more than on the Shield.",negative
7425,3.0,It's good but to get more connection and less buffing get the one with the Internet cable,negative
7426,5.0,Its definitely a great purchase. Its definitely an upgrade from the fire stick.,positive
7427,5.0,Great purchase and the product is amazingly simple,positive
7428,5.0,This product has been amazing! We got a great deal on the purchase and we have not been disappointed with it's productivity!,positive
7429,5.0,I have 2 of these in my home and love them. Alexa voice commands are fun to mess with. I use these for Amazon Prime Services and Netflix mostly. This model is more than double the speed of the sticks and have 4K support. I love the expandable storage and the fact I have KODI on these bad boys makes it all the better.,positive
7430,5.0,"This fire box is the best you can get for a cheap price. It runs surprising well and so far have had no issues with wifi streaming Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Netflix. Definitely even worth more if you have Prime for the streaming from Amazon. Only minor problem is restrictions on most add-on apps due to going through Amazon and not Google Play but there are various work arounds.",positive
7431,5.0,I found this product to be faster the other competitors products,positive
7432,5.0,"This is my second unit, this one is 1080p with 4k ultra high definition built in and I love it, if you buy one, you will also love it.",positive
7433,4.0,Really easy to work with lots of extras. Good buy for kids and adults,positive
7434,4.0,"The Amazon Fire TV is a great streaming box. I also have the Amazon Fire TV Stick which is just as good. The reason I gave the Fire TV only 4-stars is because I see no reason to even have the Fire TV as the Fire TV Stick is just as good if not better, considering its size, than the box. Sure with the box you get better performing specs out of it but what for? In my performance reviews, the Fire TV Stick performed on par with the Fire TV box. The choice is up to you as they are both great streaming devices. However, save yourself some money and go with the Fire TV Stick!",positive
7435,5.0,"I picked up the Fire TV because I already owned 3 Fire Sticks and was happy with them. I wanted a unit that I was familiar with and I""m glad I bought this one. I don't really use Alexa so that didn't play a part in the purchase. However, you really see the dual core processing power when you start apps. It's a good bit faster than the Fire Sticks with the same ease of use. As an added bonus, you can install and play games. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",positive
7436,5.0,"I had a fire tv stick and it works great, so wanted to try the fire tv box. Works great and loads much faster.",positive

7555,4.0,"I bought this device to use to replace an Xbox One (for movies/streaming etc not gaming) - so far streaming movies, using the cloud to upload videos/photos work good. My only issue is getting the device to power back on - there is no ""power off"" you can put the device to ""sleep"" but I have had to unplugged it several times to get the unit back online - so far that is my only negative issue",positive
7556,5.0,This is perfect. I wanted to cut the cord and I used the free 30 day amazon prime trial. I definitely recommend getting playstation vue!!,positive

7559,5.0,Was skeptical about getting rid of cable...love Amazon fire! So many choices and so much cheaper!,positive
7560,5.0,Have a Fire stick tv in tvs and upgraded to Fire box tv. Much faster and expandable memory with micro SD slot. Also can direct connect with Ethernet cable.,positive
7561,5.0,"Setup for the Amazon Fire TV box was very easy. I was surprised at how little the box actually was, and just how powerful some of the apps and downloadable games were that you can use on the Amazon Fire TV.I ended up ordering the Amazon Fire TV game controller online at Amazon. I am currently not an Amazon Prime member, but may re-consider that decision in time to get even more functionality out of the box.For anyone looking to buy a relatively cheap device to maximize their TV watching and even Console game playing, look no further than the Amazon Fire TV. Although it does not compare to a Playstation IV or X-Box it does have decent graphics on some of the available games.I had also purchased a class 10 64 GB micro SD card for the Amazon Fire TV Box as well and had no trouble formatting it and getting it setup.",positive
7562,4.0,Love not paying cable bill. Just wish we could get sling blue.,positive
7563,5.0,"Have the gaming version myself but got the normal version for my sister. Can easily load any apps or games you want to run, provided they are android based.

Probably be a go to Christmas give this year.",positive

7576,3.0,"So, its ok. I mean, it's not as fast or as seamless as the Apple TV, but it's cheaper. This is my 2nd one. The first one bricked after 15 months of steady use, so because the warranty was expired I bought a new one. I got it home and the remote stopped working for it on the 2nd day. I had just spent a week going back and forth with Amazon trying to troubleshoot my bricked firebox so I wasn't about to delve back into the quagmire that is Amazon customer service. I ended up just downloading the remote app for it instead. If you're a prime member it's a good choice, but if your not just get an Apple TV or roku.",negative
7577,5.0,The Amazon Fire TV is an awesome system. We love it and use it every day!,positive
7578,5.0,"Highly recommend, fast reliable signal, great quality and convient",positive
7579,4.0,This is a great streaming device. Easy to use and user friendly. It says it plays 4K which is a plus. I've streamed Amazon and ps Vue on here and read that games can be played too. I am a chrome cast user so am used to managing everything on my phone not a remote but the remote is nice and has voice control which is great. I just wish the fire tv app would show what you see on screen so you can navigate from your phone instead of having it look like a mousepad. It takes getting used to. Overall it is great addition to my streaming devices.,positive
7580,5.0,"Works great even downstairs from my nighthawk router, responds much quicker than fire stick and works great with ps Vue. For sure get this over the stick.",positive

7587,5.0,Love it! Very convenient. Simple to install. No more cable,positive

7589,4.0,"Great piece of hardware for the price - maybe needs a slgihtly better app selection, but 4K compatible and microSD card slot makes this a a great device for streaming video.",positive
7590,5.0,It was really a good idea to buy it during summer. Kids had great time in between other summer activities.,positive

7594,3.0,"The old Fire TV's had an optical audio out S/PDIF, the new ones only have an HDMI output. Great if you have a new A/V setup that has HDMI pass-through on the receiver, not so good if you want to run video through HDMI and audio to your receiver.I should have probably considered a Roku.",negative
7595,2.0,Seems to be a great unit with great accessibility.,negative
7596,5.0,This is hands down the best media streaming device available today. If you have a 4k tv the box enhances the resolution any other tv the sticks will work fine.,positive
7597,5.0,"Set up was easy, content is plenty. My only issue so far is that I use the Amazon fire tv for Playstation Vue, and the guide functionality is horrible. I'm not sure whether to blame it on the amazon fire tv or the playstation vue, but considering the guide is different between the amazon fire tv and the fire stick, I'm going to assume that amazon has some control over the guide for it's products. With that being said I'm definitely disappointed. Hopefully over the next couple months the guide functionality improves. Other than that it has been fantastic!",positive
7598,3.0,"Have not used for standard fire tv features. Bought to run kodi, which it works fine for. Freezes occasionally needing hard reboot. Worth the extra $ over doing kodi on streaming stick which lacks memory / cpu.",negative
7599,5.0,"I've owned a fire stick, chromecast, Apple TV and Roku, This is by far my favorite device for cutting cords!",positive

7640,4.0,"If you need help making a decision in what product to buy then hope I can quickly help you make that decision. This is a great product for 90% of us out there. If you have a 4K TV then get the 2016 version of the Fire TV. If you have to decide between a Firestick or a Fire TV then get the Fire TV. The processor speed difference alone is worth the price difference. If you want the best out there then the Nvidia Shield TV is for you. Either way, Amazon made a great product in the Fire TV. Some key features are the microSD expansion, ability to use a controller for some mild gaming, and voice activated remote. Get Prime and have access to all of Amazon's video and music streamin service..",positive

7672,4.0,The FireTV unit was very easy to set up. Just had to connect the HDMI cable to the box and the TV and we were in business. The remote control worked great - although inside of HULU it took a little time to figure out how to get back to the HULU home page (just keep hitting the return button) -- but that's a HULU issue. The FireTV connected quickly to the home WIFI.,positive
7673,5.0,I love how you can play games on it and have all of your account all-in-one!!!,positive

7685,5.0,I love these because they are able to be programmed and watch anything and everything in the world!,positive
7686,5.0,"We had a Netgear streaming device for years which was adequate until the remote quit functioning. After checking it out online and visiting the store I felt comfortable purchasing this device. It was easy to setup and get online. It is amazing how much faster, better and smoother our streaming has been. The built in apps are good and there were many more (free) apps that I found and installed without a problem. Some that I installed required that I have a cable TV subscription and so I had to ""log in"" to get them functional but not a big deal. The unit itself is not cheap in appearance nor in quality. It has a nice weight to it and feels substantially durable. The remote is great and the Android App is even better. My local Best Buy store had enough in stock and no hassles. We love our Amazon Fire TV!",positive
7687,5.0,Purchased the Fire Box a couple of months ago and it's a great addition to the theatre room for watching movies. Easy to use and good download speed.,positive

7694,5.0,"Totally satisfied. Also own Apple TV, which I ended up moving to bedroom and putting fire stick on main TV. Fire stick seems to be more ""open"" to multiple programmings compared to App Store only programs with Apple TV. But, In defense for Apple TV it's syncing abilities with my iPhone and MacBook are well received. Price wise Firestick has the advantage.",positive
7695,5.0,"Love IT!, Simple to use, very fast response as to my DVD with NetflixI recommend to have IT!",positive

7705,5.0,I ended up having to get this or a Roku to use my playstation vue since my Samsung smart tv doesn't allow it. This works great!,positive
7706,4.0,"If you dont mind taking a few extra steps to download programs then its great. We got rid of cable and have amazon instead. Also love the voice command, just wish game controller wasn't so much the systym was 99 and the game controller is 50.",positive

7713,5.0,This Firebox allows you to upgrade memory to store content.I love how it has alexa on it.,positive
7714,5.0,These things are awesome. I buy them all the time for my employees as bonuses or gifts. They are reliable and durable. Don't over heat and hold up nicely. Great product.,positive
7715,5.0,I currently have two fire TVs in my home. Prior to this I had an apple TV which was the one before the newest generation of 2016. It became obsolete with slow streaming speeds all the time. After purchasing the Fire TV I can honestly say its the best bargain in town. The price is just right and has not been an issue in speed or clarity for streaming all your favorite movies shows. The ease of use is also a big plus. I highly recommend if you are on the fence.,positive
7716,5.0,Well worth the money. It does everything it say it will do and more.,positive
7717,4.0,We are able to watch lots of different programming,positive
7718,5.0,Lots of content to access 4k quality easy setup and easy to navigate,positive
7719,4.0,"Compared to Roku provides more flexibility for those who like to use these units beyond standard. I don't give 5 stars because the interface is okay, but I much prefer Plex's looking view.I was going insane with my slow Samsung ""Smart Hub"" tv on my second TV... purchasing this was a good decision.Overall I recommend these units.",positive
7720,5.0,Love this thing. I've had my 4K tv for a while now and now I feel it's complete with the Fire TV. Lots of ways to find and watch 4K content.,positive
7721,5.0,I was really surprised at how much you can do with Fire TV. Thank you,positive
7722,5.0,"One of the best products to have, save so much money on the long run. I use this instead of having cable and it works even better. It's half the cost of one monthly cable bill and I have access to 100x more channels. You will need one amazon tv box per tv unless you don't mind moving it from the living room to the bedroom.",positive
7723,5.0,I enjoy this product. So easy to attach and use by all,positive
7724,4.0,I bought it to help with cutting the cord. I use it mostly to access PlayStation vue service and it works great. If i were a amazon prime member i imagine it would be great to access the prime content. The fire box allows for direct wire to the modem and loads faster than the fire stick which is wifi only.,positive
7725,5.0,The Fire TV is the best device to stream PlayStaion Vue. Its super fast and Alexa is amazing.,positive
7726,4.0,it works better than the other product that I have,positive
7727,5.0,Had the fire stick but I just bought a 4K tv and upgraded the Netflix to stream 4K. Loved the fire stick so much only made sense to buy the fire tv box. It's super easy to use. Great interface.,positive
7728,4.0,I had a non smart tv and this was easy to use and very efficient.,positive
7729,5.0,I have had a blast since I purchased this Amazon Fire tv. I had issues with the remote but after calling they immediately sent me a replacement. Great service and I am considering reducing my cable now since I can do so much cheaper through this item now.,positive
7730,5.0,Now my bedroom TV is the smartest TV in the house. The voice command makes this a breeze to use. It hooks me up to Netflix in seconds instead of minutes like the blue-ray players on my other TV's.,positive
7731,5.0,"Love it, had Roku 2,3 and this replaced all of them. Would high recommend this over Fire Stick, faster and can add extra memory...Cut cable and use this as our primary tv source along with antenna for local channels kid love as well very easy to use...",positive
7732,5.0,"Good device, use it often, wish I would have waited for a sale. Otherwise, works well, I've been using this more and more, especially given the rising costs of cable. If you can wait until the next day to catch your show, and have an HD antennae, you can say bye bye to cable bills (minus the internet, of course). Love what you can do with this, with the included remote, if you have an alexa home system set up with hubs, the voice remote can be used to control alexa. If you're looking for a cheaper version, the stick will work, but if you game at all, this is your best bet, especially with the quicker processor",positive
7733,5.0,"I purchased Chromecasts the year they came out and while they served their purpose for two years they are just not very upgradable. I recently bought the Fire Stick and Fire TV Box made by Amazon. I am also a Netflix and Amazon Prime member. Both of these devices are FAR Superior to the options provided by the older Chromecasts AND even the new 4K models. Easy to use and upgradable with many apps and games, and if you have Amazon Prime it is a no-brainer purchase.",positive
7734,5.0,"Could not be happier with this purchase. The voice activated command button on the remote works fantastic. If you do not have a smart TV, highly recommend this device. It buffers for maybe 5 seconds to start a show and then displays perfectly.",positive
7735,4.0,This box was definitely worth the upgrade than the stick. It's snappier and easy to install programs on.,positive
7736,5.0,Great price for the product you receive. Great way to cut cable bill.,positive
7737,5.0,This workshould so much better then the firend stick.,positive
7738,5.0,"The Amazon Fire TV box is the best choice for your money. It runs smoothly, it's user friendly and it has a great user interface. It has 2gb of memory which is a plus, and it allows you to connect directly to your modem via Ethernet. I find this especially helpful when you are having issues with your wifi or you have many devices in your home connected to your wifi. I have not had any issues with this box!",positive
7739,4.0,Fire TV was easy set up and had no buffering issues.,positive
7740,5.0,We use this product to side load apps like Kodi. It works really well. I have never experienced any freezing of any kind or any lag time like I have with other products.,positive
7741,5.0,This product is great. I bought it because it was cheaper than paying a cable bill.,positive
7742,5.0,"Amazon Fire TV is the best streaming device money can buy and will cancel cox, directv and any other programming paying for. It works smoothly with good internet service and cable modem. Best device on market to stream movies and tv shows. Will keep buying them for my family.",positive
7743,4.0,Best product to use if your are a movie watcher.i use mine on weekends when it's time to relax or nothing to do.,positive

7746,5.0,"I love the fire tv for so many reasons! It is easy to take along anywhere and you can easily add apps, no need for cable!",positive
7747,5.0,"The Amazon fire TV is a simple to install and use as advertised. All you need is your own HDMI cable and everything else is provided for you. Set up took minutes. I really like how fast the Fire TV is. I use it almost exclusively for Netflix, Hulu, and live TV streaming thru PlayStation Vue. I chose the Fire TV over the TV stick because the Fire TV has a faster processor and it works beautifully. I would definitely recommend this box for anyone who's looking to cut the cord from cable.",positive
7748,5.0,So happy I made this purchase! Works great for our family. Super fast. No buffering.,positive
7749,5.0,The box works great for what I need it for. Installation was easy. Easy to move around within the apps,positive
7750,5.0,"I did my research and purchased one of these for one purpose, to side load Kodi on it. I was told in the store by an Associate that Amazon had blocked this ability, but this was not true. I had no intention of Rooting the box and it was not needed. It side loaded so simply that anyone could do it, no PC needed. It has a faster processing speed and better picture quality then the Amazon Fire Stick..and this does 4K video. Amazing little media box that has tons of entertainment for a small price. If you have fast enough internet I would highly recommend picking one up!",positive
7751,5.0,"I love all of my Amazon products including my latest purchase the Amazon fire box. I have the stick o, two tv's and now the box on my new 4k tv. Along with my prime account I am in heaven...",positive
7752,4.0,I recommend this product many movies and very clear.,positive
7753,5.0,"Love, love love it! Great for turning your tv into a smart tv!",positive
7754,5.0,"Just speak into the remote and your thrust on a journey through movies,Internet and shopping.",positive
7755,5.0,Amazon knocks it out of the park with this Fire TV. Very easy to use and runs apps faster than Roku. Well worth the money,positive
7756,5.0,Have bought 5 of these. Good wifi and has an Ethernet port much faster than fire stick,positive
7757,5.0,It is fast and affordable streaming player. All app are supported.,positive
7758,5.0,Anything I have time to watch I can see on this box. Cuts cable bill in half.,positive
7759,5.0,SIMPLE AND VERY USER FRIENDLY. HAS ALL THE LATEST APPS AND AMAZON'S PRIME USER CONTENT IS SUPERB.,positive
7760,5.0,I recently cut cable. This device has all of the apps I want to stream. It has a fast processor and the voice remote works great.,positive
7761,5.0,"Less lag than the stick. Ethernet port option is nice. Not too much need though if you wont use extensively. If your a passive user go stick, if you'll everyday and even want to do gaming go box.",positive
7762,4.0,"I decided to cut cable and thought this Amazon TV would be a good alternative . It's a great product I really do like it ! It takes a little while to get used to using it ,there's a lot of clicking to get to a show ! However , I am not a prime member so there are a lot of shows that we can't watch !",positive
7763,5.0,really like the fire tv works great. def an upgrade from the apple tv,positive
7764,5.0,"This product is worth the price. Apple TV may have better features and can link to your laptop and phone, but for the price, Amazon Fire TV is great!",positive
7765,5.0,Have owned several roku models and now trying firetv. Definite improvement especially after recent software upgrade. Works great with my prime account & amazon video library.,positive
7766,5.0,I have the Amazon stick and wanted a little more speed and storage which this was just great for.,positive
7767,5.0,"I never thought it would be possible to get rid of my cable television services, but I did.",positive
7768,5.0,"I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I'm loving it! I have an older Samsung ""Smart"" TV, but Samsung has stopped updating the Smart Hub for my model. The Amazon Fire TV gets the latest updates from the Apps (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, etc...) , so I know everything will work smoothly!",positive
7769,4.0,"With this device, you no longer need anything but wifi.",positive
7770,4.0,"Definitely has nice features, however, I prefer the navigation on the Apple TV.",positive
7771,5.0,"Love this box, plenty of power for my 60in tv, beautiful picture and sound. Key features for me were the internet hardline even though the wifi in this unit works great and the usb. Easily add on a usb keyboard to make your experience that much better.",positive
7772,5.0,Device is user friendly. Very easy to navigate and much faster than the FireStick. Can also install Kodi unlike other streaming devices.,positive
7773,4.0,way faster then the firesticks better wifi and comes with voice remote,positive
7774,5.0,"Firesticks are cheap, but getting the fire tv meant less buffer time and less lag before watching my shows!",positive
7775,5.0,"There are so many advantages to the Fire TV box. It has an Ethernet connection and a USB port. Add a wireless keyboard or flash drive. It's got 4K and it is fast. The fire stick is more reasonable priced but it's not as fast and doesn't have any USB or Ethernet connection. If you have a few bucks more, go for the Fire TV box.",positive
7776,5.0,"This device has amazing features and is much better than the Apple TV with a larger range of available apps. One most prominently is Sling TV, that is not supported by the iOS device. Also this version is much better than the Fire TV Stick due to memory and most importantly the ethernet connection. Definitely worth the extra amount over the Fire TV Stick.",positive
7777,4.0,Love this product and LOVE Amazon! It replaced my old Fire TV.,positive
7778,4.0,This Fire TV works great. I would recommend having Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix. Also if you know anything about KODI you should DEFINITELY add that.,positive
7779,5.0,They run way faster then the sticks but I have both,positive
7780,5.0,"Awesome device, no cable for...one in every room, plug and play",positive
7781,4.0,"My son gave this to me for a B-day gift! Music, movies, shows - and some news. Since I ""cut the cable"" I find that there really is very little news that I can't get elsewhere. No more news-fix required! Works with my Fire Tablet too!",positive
7782,5.0,"I already had purchased a Fire Stick, because I am a gadget nut and, well, reasons... *heh*. I decided to move up as part of a cord cutting drive, and this unit really shines. With more compute power and buffering space, it does a really nice job, even on fast moving source material. I also like the voice input.",positive
7783,5.0,"This would be a perfect gift for anyone. Easy to use, and we'll put together device.",positive
7784,5.0,"firebox is small but fast, runs great and takes no time at all to set up",positive
7785,5.0,Had this for 2 days before I cut my cable off. Works great with lots of apps.,positive
7786,5.0,"We needed this Amazon Fire- TV in order to watch Amazon Prime on our new smart TV, which we also bought at Best Buy, It was easy to set up and works great, but it didn't come with a connecting cord and the salesman didn't say it needed one. Had to make a trip back next day.",positive
7787,5.0,"This system works great, even my five year old son can navigate channels with the remote or voice control. Has parental controls for purchases and viewing. Subscription required for some viewing.",positive
7788,4.0,Overall this device is great. No problem with performance and usage. My only fault I think they can advance on is the remote. the current one is nice and sleek but lack the ability to type. Hitting the arrow keys to search for anything is a pin. Second I would add the ability to search for Apps a little more easily. Finally the web browsing is not the best and definitely needs advanced on.,positive
7789,4.0,"With the cost of cable being overly costly, I've looked at ways to cut the cable. Adding an HD antenna for local channels, I opted for a FireTv to supplement our tv watching. I already had a Netflix and Hulu streaming account ($20 a mo) so already saving $100+ per mo. Add the benefit of adding numerous free apps...you have a great amount of programming you can enjoy.",positive
7790,5.0,"These units get better and better. Lots of apps available. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Why pay 100's of dollars more for a smart tv that is restricted to only a few dozen apps. Amazon has thousands of apps from movies and tv shows, to games and entertainment. Great option for any tv in your house.",positive
7791,5.0,I love my Firestick! I dropped my cable a year ago and dont miss it at all!,positive
7792,4.0,This product is very useful for watching tv and streaming Netflix and others. Easy to use and easy to hook up. Works great! Good alternative to a smart tv..,positive
7793,5.0,I bought this to use for streaming services and it works great,positive
7794,5.0,The Amazon Fire TV is a quality product at an affordable price. Less expensive than Apple TV and more capable with a good app eco system. Also able to stream UHD.,positive
7795,4.0,I had to buy this item due to the store no longer having the Firestick in the store. Set up was easy and dry easy to use.,positive

7800,5.0,"I researched several streaming devices but because of my experience with Amazon Kindle Fire and the reviews read for the Fire TV I decided to do the Amazon Fire TV. Set up was easy (the hardest part was opening the remote to put the batteries in!). Once everything was hooked up, the instructions and tips video really helped get everything started. The only negative I will say is that this product did not include the HDMI cable (other brands did) but that was explained on the box and by the sales associate. I enjoyed this so much that I ordered the TV Stick for my bedroom TV. (And have recommended this product to friends and co-workers.)",positive
7801,5.0,We ordered the FireTV because it has an ethernet connection for quicker speeds. It also is 4K ready so when we get a 4K TV its ready to stream 4K content from youtube.,positive
7802,5.0,Side loaded with kodi and loving no cable bill. Well worth the money.,positive
7803,5.0,Much better than fire stick. Downloads much quicker,positive
7804,5.0,Excellent alternative to paying the big companies a bunch of money.,positive
7805,5.0,It works great for Netflix and amazon streaming I love these boxes,positive

7943,5.0,"Performs much better than the TV Fire Stick gen1 and still able to side load Android apps APK. We were able to load some international apks that allows us to stream TV shows from different countries onto the Fire TV.We could do this with the fire stick to, but occasionally the stream would hang.Not sure if the improved performance is due to upgraded CPU and RAM, or with wired (ethernet) connection (instead of wifi) or both.

CONS: The remote is very basic and it could use a few more buttons, there is no volume or power on/off buttons so you will have multiple remote controls lying around. If you have a smart tv you may not need this as the apps you are looking for may be available on it. PROS: quick, responsive, very sleek and small. Combines everything you need and more.",positive

7982,4.0,"I bought this thinking I would be a cord cutter, but the service I have if I do that would make just my internet within $$ of what I pay for both internet & TV. BUT...I love the extra choices that the Fire TV Box gives. SO many choices to try, some free, some free trials and some pay that I really enjoy. Cons...you DO need a very stable internet connection for this device and I wish there was more guidance available on use. Set up was E-Z.

8007,4.0,"The Amazon Fire TV box hooks to cable modem easily and is very user-friendly. Great for Amazon Prime members. The only issue is that there is not enough 4K content out there and, in my opinion, does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable Amazon Fire TV stick. Yes, the box has a faster processor and more RAM than the stick, but for content, I've had NO PROBLEM with the stick and it's cheaper.",positive
8008,5.0,I love it it works like a charm. I would recommend it to friends and family.,positive
8009,4.0,Fire TV is great to watch our favorite movies and shows on. We have great wi-fi but some things play better than others on the Fire. The buffering when it does this will get on your nerves but all in all we like Fire TV.,positive

8013,5.0,"This is the best smart tv box out there, I've tried Roku, and I'm not a big fan, also have seen Apple TV, and used to own a google chrome cast, but the amazon tv is the easiest to use, and I think is the best bang for the buck! Even if you have a smart TV I recommend buying an Amazon tv box. Watching any Netflix, or Amazon prime videos is easy, loads super fast, and works great. Especially if you download the Kodi app on the box!! I am a loyal customer as I have 4 Amazon tv boxes in my home!",positive

With my movie collection on my server, I was able to install Kodi on the Fire TV and continue to stream my movies over the network. Add in our subscription to Netflix, HBO GO, Stars Play, and Amazon Prime membership, the Fire TV offers a wide range of entertainment.",positive
8025,5.0,"Since the most recent update, we really like the fire tv. We like that the fire tv includes an alexa remote since we have our lights connected to our dot. Before watching a film, we can dim the lights using the remote. The interface of the fire tv obviously emphasizes Prime video so it may be useless for those non-Prime users; however, Fire tv has a lot of apps that you can use. I was disappointed that VUDU was not on fire tv, though.",positive
8026,5.0,Terrific purchase that was enabled with an Amazon Prime membership. We just love watching TV shows and movies in the privacy of our home using the Amazon Fire TV device. Simple to setup...less than 5 minutes and we were on our way.,positive

Our Rokus freeze up frequently, but the Fire TV has only done this once. (So far!) We will probably buy a second one for our bedroom and move the Roku 3 to a guest bedroom.",positive

8045,5.0,"My wife and I have been cordcutting for a while with a Roku TV on one TV and a PS4, I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV...WOW this device is beyond awesome. I live the alexa integration to find movies. the only way it would be better is if Alexa could tune to channels on PlayStation Vue. The ability to clone my Android phone to this device is great as well. I would very highly recommend this device",positive
8046,5.0,Very similar to the fire stick but it seems a bit faster when downloading.,positive
8047,5.0,Item as described!!!! Excellent media center !!! Esasy to install !!!,positive
8048,3.0,"i purchased this in hopes of making my existing tv a smart tv, honestly i was kind of disappointed. for starters the remote quite a few times lost sync with the box and i had to download the fire tv app to reset the box. second it froze constantly in the middle of using amazon prime it would freeze up. now this might just have been the bad one in the batch, i dont know but i returned it and are looking for something different.",negative

Just to give you all an idea, I was PAYING about $$$$125.00 plus, plus, plus amonth, in cable, that's about $$$1500 plus, plus, plus a year. So now I with NETFLIX, AMAZON PRIME & SLING TV going to pay about $40.00 a moth, that's about $500 per year..... Plus there is other goodies that comes with it.

8054,5.0,love it nice and clean powerful tv box fast shipping from best buy all the time,positive
8055,4.0,"This is a very capable player. It is comparable to the Roku 4 or AppleTV. There are a few caveats though. The device works best if you have Amazon account, preferably an Amazon Prime account. It allows you to access the Amazon Video library, download apps, and use Alexa voice search. Unfortunately, there is an additional annual fee for the service. There is a free option, but it limits the ability of the device. The device also lacks true YouTube support. You're redirected to a website like interface to view videos. With YouTube beginning to roll out 4K content, it makes you wonder why this device doesn't have a dedicated YouTube app to showcase the 4K ability. If you have an Amazon Prime account, this device works very well. Otherwise, I would recommend doing some research, such as looking at the Roku 4, which has a more well-rounded set of features.",positive
8056,4.0,"I mostly bought this to give me Amazon Prime with HDR as it was not available on my Nvidia Shield. It does a great job, and has excellent performance and speed with the menus and such. Very intuitive and easy to use. That all said, the Nvidia shield received an update today that adds Amazon Prime, so it will probably become my device of choice again.",positive

8061,5.0,Perfect to watch anything I need small and to the point,positive

8082,5.0,"The fire stick has more than enough to offer in entertainment, something for every one's taste. The programming is not disappointing. The equipment is inexpensive and you.have control of any other expenses like subscriptions. Your bill will be far less than a cable bill and you will have more enjoyment from the programs.

Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription.

8183,4.0,"I know not everyone wants to read a direct comparison to an Apple TV rather than a review on the moerits of this device, but I have owned both and stuck with the Apple TV instead of this.The Apps I used (DirecTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) choked and buffered much more often, or froze completely. The wifi reception was also sub par.The remote is good, and I prefer the batteries approach to Apple's rechargeable one. Everything else though, the Apple TV seemed to do better.My two cents. Still a solid streaming device, and the price is better than Apple's. I would make the decision based on how plugged into Amazon's ecosystem you are vs. Apple's.",positive

8187,5.0,Runs flawlessly...Love The Fact It's Not Just Wi-Fi Enabled,positive
8188,4.0,Great product to watch shows online. Only downside is that you can't stream/cast computer screens easily like a chrome cast can. Being able to talk into the app or remote makes it really easy to navigate the system to find things fast,positive
8189,5.0,Works great we are Amazon prime so love the shows ! I am using this with wireless .,positive
8190,5.0,This item is so great. I love it. I bought 2 of this before and gave it to my family member and they loved it too.,positive

8195,5.0,I wish I didn't wait to get this. It is so much faster than using a DVD player for apps like Hulu and Netfliz. Plus the voice serach is handy.,positive
8196,5.0,"Works great! Get all my shows and movies. Even gets my hockey channels. 4K, 1080p, HD, and standard viewing options. So worth it, i bought 2 more!!!",positive
8197,5.0,My primary interest in streaming (this was new to me) was to stream The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime. I figured an Amazon device was the easiest way to do this. And I was correct. The Fire TV is easy to use and works great. I have fast internet (50-60 mpbs download) so I have no complaints about picture quality.,positive
8198,5.0,Better performance and more options that my firestick. As it should for the extra cost and added size. Still a nice compact little package though. Very happy with this purchase and runs all of the programs I use very well. Expandable storage is a huge plus!,positive

8202,5.0,I suggest this to anyone looking to watch Netflix and Hulu simple.,positive
8203,5.0,I looked at the reviews between the stick and the box. I choose the box because it connects to the Ethernet.,positive
8204,5.0,Friends were pleased with gift will be buying one for their family.,positive
8205,5.0,"This allows us to watch what we want to watch ,when we want to watch it.",positive

8207,5.0,"Best product out there, worth buying all day, wouldnt pass on it",positive
8208,5.0,Liked this product so much that I have purchased two more and plan on buying more for all our televisions.,positive
8209,5.0,I really like the Fire TV. We've had one in our living room for several years and I bought this one for my wife for Christmas to put in the bedroom. Great utility and very easy to sue.,positive
8210,5.0,"Bought this for my dad to watch Netflix, and it works very well. Easy to use, which is a bonus",positive
8211,5.0,I got the Fire TV so that I can watch Directv Now. It works really well and is right up there with the Roku Premiere + that I also own.,positive

8213,5.0,This amazon fire tv was a great gift. many movies at your finger tips,positive

8215,5.0,Bought this to run the Kodi app. It's awesome!!!!!,positive
8216,5.0,This was a Christmas gift andmy son is pleased with it!,positive
8217,5.0,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it. I was undecided between the Fire stick or the Fire TV and since a coworker has the Fire TV and loved it I went with the Fire TV as opposed to the stick - especially since there is more memory in the Fire TV (the TV is about 50.00 more but worth it),positive
8218,4.0,"My girlfriend and I have essentially become cord cutters so we had to find a box top set so that we could watch our Netflix, Directtv, and HBO. We got this because it was recommended by a friend. The user interface is simple and it works great if you have Amazon Prime. The main issue we have is when we forget to put it to sleep, which i recommend you do, is that the apps stall and don't start up right away. I'm not sure if it's the apps or the Fire TV itself. Its bothersome at times but it's nothing that we have to get replaced.",positive
8219,1.0,I tried this out for a few weeks and it does not have nearly the programs that it says it does. I would rather pay for Netflix or Hulu.,negative
8220,3.0,This product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it does have more memory and an option where you can add an SD card to it but other than that it is the same as a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box,negative
8221,4.0,Pretty easy to use once we went thru it with our grandkids. We are not technically savvy.,positive
8222,4.0,"The Amazon Fire TV box is better than using the ""smart"" software built-in on any Blu-ray player or TV I've owned. Those brands include Sony, Mitsubishi, and Samsung. It is very responsive when navigating menus and making selections. If you're not an Amazon Prime member, be prepared to have that in your face - this is an Amazon device after all. The remote is minimalist in style and has the mic built-in for speaking to Alexa, which is a plus in my book.",positive
8223,5.0,Fire tv loads faster than the stick. Works great with amazon prime.,positive
8224,5.0,Love that Prime membership allows me to see all other movies...bye bye Netflix,positive
8225,5.0,This device streams available content smoothly. Plan to buy another one for children.,positive

8231,5.0,Absolutely best amazon product ever! Very easy to navigate. Love everything about it.,positive
8232,5.0,"This was purchased to replace the fire stick. If you're debating between the fire stick and the fire TV, get the fire tv box. Waiting for the fire stick to power on and connect to wifi, or trying to type anything with a directional pad wastes too much time!",positive
8233,5.0,"It was a gift, so i can really only comment on the quality of the box. It was very square and well proportioned. The cellophane was slick but not overly so. Overall a decent tactile sensation.",positive
8234,5.0,"Bought this for a raffle gift, and everyone wanted to win it. I personally have one too, and love it.",positive
8235,5.0,So easy to use my parents can even figure it out good quality,positive
8236,5.0,"My first one didn't work, but was easily exchanged at Best Buy. New one works great, I watch streaming tv on it thru the PS Vue app. The Fire box is much quicker and smoother than the Fire stick.",positive
8237,5.0,I was able to catch this thing on sale Black Friday for $70. It could possible be the best $70 I have ever spent. Everyone should own a amazon fire tv!,positive
8238,4.0,This thing works pretty good. That is unless you are trying to stream Directv Now reliably. Probably not Amazon's fault though. Everything else works flawlessly.,positive
8239,5.0,"This item allowed me to turn my tv into not only a smart tv, but a game console. Is great for family games.",positive
8240,4.0,Good upgrade to the Firestick. Alexa search works well so you can quickly find titles.,positive
8241,5.0,I love this product i have several flat screen tvs and i have bought several of these fire sticks as i unlock the stick to put kodi on it so i can watch all the latest and greatest shows for free including im movie theaters and live tv i would hogjly recommend this product especially if u know how to unlock the stick ;),positive
8242,5.0,"this is a fantastic item, love the simplicity of its use",positive
8243,5.0,I love being able to choose what I want to watch!!,positive
8244,5.0,Use it everyday...sign up for amazon prime and watch almost anything..,positive
8245,4.0,Wish we could get some free stuff with it. Might have to get amazon prime to get more stuff,positive
8246,5.0,Fire tv is to Android users as to Apple TV to Apple users. It's fast and never has any issues streaming,positive

8249,4.0,I have cancelled Direct TV and I am using this plaform for personal entertainment.......love it and love the fact that I don't have one those big DirectTV DVR monstrosties sitting in front of my TV anymore which I was paying a monthly fee for. Love Amazon Prime platform there is so much free content available if your a Prime member. I choose this over apple TV because apple charges for everything and can get expensive like Direct TV.,positive
8250,5.0,If you plan to watch live TV. Get this one.If not fire stick is good.Also get this if you plan to install other apps as it has upgradeable memory,positive
8251,5.0,"Kodi fans get the TV! Even if you have the stick, upgrade. You'll be happy you did. Very cool item!!!!",positive
8252,4.0,purchased for Kodi and 1st time setup was little bit time taking process. after that everything good.. getting 4k resolution and flexible to carry anywhere.. buffering is good when you connected through internet cable instead of wifi,positive

8256,5.0,"Very smooth operating system and easy to use for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc",positive
8257,5.0,What else can I say? This is an awesome little device and is leading me towards cutting out cable altogether.,positive
8258,5.0,"Easy set-up, We figure that we can cut our cable bill almost $80 - $100 a month by using this. Also getting more channels we will watch, instead of paying for the cable companies choices that we don't care for.",positive
8259,5.0,Couldn't be happier works as expected and price was fair.,positive
8260,5.0,The fire tv has been a cool utility to add to the entertainment department in our household. Much more responsive than the stick... hardly any lag. Continuous updates from Amazon keeps the UI fresh & ever evolving content is a plus.,positive

8262,5.0,what an amazing device. super fast in comparison to the fire tv stick. best streaming device available in my opinion!,positive
8263,4.0,This is a very good product and excited to use it.,positive
8264,4.0,Bought the unit as it has apps that allow for linking my Sling TV device and freeing up my IPad and Apple TV all in one box.,positive

8266,4.0,Best streaming device. For the price better than Apple TV,positive
8267,5.0,The Amazon Firestick with voice remote is very easy to set up and very easy to use. The voice remote makes finding what you want to watch very easy.,positive

8269,5.0,I purchased this for my bedroom since I have the stick downstairs close to my Wifi router and have had no issues with it. This is even better than the stick and has no buffering or lag issues whatsoever for the normal things I watch and stream. Highly recommended!,positive
8270,5.0,I purchased the amazon Fire Tv as a way to save money by canceling my cable subscription which was around $150 a month. I used it on my old Samsung tv and purchased a subscription to Netflix around $10 plus high speed internet $40 and side loaded Kodi free for a total saving's of $100. so far I've purchased around 5 amazon fire tv's.,positive
8271,5.0,I love it because it saves me money. Easy to use. Great value.,positive

8282,5.0,I use it every day. 4k shows like the Grand Tour look impressive. Set up is easy.,positive

8285,5.0,Great item to have. Consolidate all your apps to watch shows. No issues at all.,positive
8286,4.0,"All the important Apps are loaded on this HDMI device. I can even side-load other Apps and Games that are not already installed on it. Nice BASIC slim remote control that's not loaded with a lot of control buttons. Easy to operate. The remote is also voice activated (I use this feature for checking weather). I use this device for watching Live TV from PlayStation Vue (much cheaper than cable or satellite TV). I like the Fire TV box much better than the Fire TV stick....it's more stable and stronger (has quad core processor, the stick is dual core). If you have strong wifi the stick maybe okay, I kept experiencing buffering issues with the stick. The Fire TV box has an Ethernet port, mini SD slot, and USB port (the stick doesn't). You will need to setup an Amazon account to use the device, but you don't have to put credit card information on it if you don't want to. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is extremely difficult to put batteries in the remote control - VERY difficult to open it. Despite that, IMO, it's worth the extra cost.",positive
8287,4.0,This is super simple to set up and use. The hardest part is using your tv provider info to gain access to some of the channels. This requires a bit of patience since you have to log in and enter codes and wait for emails to accomplish.,positive
8288,5.0,In my opinion the fire tv is definitely one of the best streaming devices out there with its awesome performance and easy to use.,positive
8289,5.0,Love it best purchase especially if you have someone to program it for you!,positive

8293,5.0,Way better than the amazon stick. I use it for kodi,positive
8294,4.0,"Very pleased with the Fire TV. I thoroughly researched alternative products before deciding on the Fire TV. The unit is fast and I enjoy the integration with Amazon Video, Netflix and other streaming services. My only issue is that the box is very simplistic cosmetically as compared with Apple TV or G Box. Other than that this is a great product.",positive

8304,5.0,Loved the box does exactly what is supposed to do stream movies all day long,positive
8305,5.0,This device does a great job of streaming from all of your accounts.,positive
8306,5.0,I had a 3 year old Roku stick which was a lot better than broadcast antenna service but with the Roku stick I often waited through long pauses while the data was buffering. The Fire TV (2015 model) is a small box on my flat screen TV stand which provides a fast friendly interface to fast streaming entertainment and almost no buffering waits. I like the small tapered remote control which is light and easy to hold and point while browsing the many options. Amazon offers Prime members a very large array of entertainment and learning selections to enjoy.,positive
8307,5.0,l love my fire tv. liked it somuch i purchased a firestick formy other tv. i use them every day!,positive
8308,5.0,Recommend to anyone interested.....................,positive

8317,4.0,No problems. Easy to setup and use. Streaming videos is pretty darn good with very little lag over my wireless router. I use a Netgear Nighthawk x6. Recomend getting the firestick tv. Great bang for the buck.,positive
8318,5.0,Great streaming device comes with alexa which is top of the line only regret is not getting the one with game controller alot of games require game controller or need it to make the game fun now im forced to buy it separately,positive
8319,2.0,"Bought the FireStick after daughter got one and loved it. Went to get a second and they were out of stock. Was told the FireTV had faster processor and could handle 4K...don't have 4K, and honestly it's not worth the extra money for the processor speed difference ...save money and buy the cheaper FireStick",negative

8325,5.0,Purchased the Fire TV over the Fire Stick because it os capable of streaming 4K. Device works great.,positive

8344,5.0,"Amazon is obviously banking on this item and the Amazon Sticks. In all fairness it is a great product with a lot to offer and a good price point. I like the Voice control feature to easily navigate through your favorite shows, movies and all.

8420,5.0,"The Amazon fire Tv is an all around great product for a great price. It is a little more expensive compared to the Fire stick but it is well worth the price difference. The Fire Tv offers 4k compability and also seems to be a little faster. It allows me to watch all my paid subscription it one place such as Netflix, Hulu and even amazon prime without have to use my PS4. All in all I would recommend this product to anyone who has paid subscription it works well with them and let you view them all in one place.",positive
8421,4.0,Set up is easy and works well from the start. Will purchase another for the extra room,positive
8422,5.0,Bought this as well as the Roku ultra.. Both are great products no issues whatsover.. If ur a bit more advanced Fire TV is more modifiable as its based on Android while Roku isnt. but still Fire TV is very simple for the basic use of even my 4 year old kid... Alexa is a great plus only one downside is it doesn't navigate within Apps to control the apps themselves it only controls Fire TVs main features... While in Roku the direct netflix button on the remote makes it slightly simpler to access netflix.. In short both are amazing products so if ur comparing u wont go wrong either way.. I would highly recommend Fire TV and am very pleased with my purchase,positive
8423,5.0,"I was having some ""stutter"" issues streaming services through my Samsung Smart TV and thought I'd try an Apple TV or Amazon Fire as an alternative. Liked the Fire's ability to stream in hire definition (already have an Apple TV on another set) and lower price. I've been using it for months. Solved my ""stutter"" problem, works great, and talking to Alexa makes it easy to search and use. Just wish the Apple TV had an Amazon app and the Fire had an Apple app.",positive

8434,5.0,The Amazon fire tv has a better resolution 4K and it already has most Apps installed on it and you can install your own too. I haven't regretted purchasing this amazing amazon amateur!!!!,positive
8435,4.0,"I have to start by saying the last thing I wanted or needed was another device in my system. Being an Apple household I would prefer that my AppleTV handle the functions that I purchased the FireTV for, namely Amazon Prime Video. But apparently the feud between Apple and Amazon won't end in favor of their customers, and Amazon won't be building a Prime Video App for ATV.So I picked up a Fire TV and have to say I'm impressed, especially for the price. Many Apps (including Prime Video and Music), Netflix, voice control, even 4K (though I haven't tried that). No AirPlay of course, so I can't get rid of my ATV, and it doesn't integrate with my Macs the way ATV does. Bottom line, I got it for Prime and it does a great job, for a non Apple house it would be all you need.",positive
8436,3.0,The media player is compact and low profile. The remote is nice. The unit/remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it. This may be due to the fact I am running Kodi. I do have a first generation firestick with Kodi that does not freeze up like this unit. The performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion.,negative

8465,5.0,"If we were going off of percentages this would get a 90%. This improves greatly over the old Fire Stick. With a faster processor, 4K support, and the freedom to install 3rd party apps, this is literally the only device you need to access just about anything you could ever need. The only gripe I have is that it is missing Vudu, otherwise, it's one of the best streamers currently available.",positive

Plus, when fast forwarding to skip commercials, you actually get to see what corresponds to the timeline, unlike the Roku Streaming Stick, which only shows the current image plus how many minutes ahead or back you can go (not the image, just the increment). With the Fire TV, you actually see the exact minute and second on the timeline along with the image at that time. Plus, Fire TV lets you fast forward up to 64x actual speed.",positive
8516,5.0,"The fire TV is definitely better than the stick. The stick used to freeze on us, but the TV doesn't seem to have any problems or delays. It works exactly as it is supposed to and helps me find programs for our son when I can't find them in other places!",positive

The music app alone is worth the price. And the set up was very easy. I am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom. It does not come with he HDMI cable, and that would be an extra $15, maybe cheaper depending where and the length you get, but it is still cheaper than an apple TV.",positive

8537,4.0,"I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it’s not cable. I miss cable, but I don’t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",positive
8538,5.0,"In an effort to cut the cord we purchased the Amazon Fire TV. It has all the apps we needed: Vue, Hulu, Netflix, Prime (obviously) as well as HBO, Showtime and the network TV station apps. It's easy to navigate and with a little setup we're cable free! Would totally recommend.",positive

8618,4.0,This product works the same as the firestick but is suppose to have 4K and better quality. To be honest it looks the same on our 70 inch 4K tv.

But I do love the Amazon product compared to other devices.,positive
8619,5.0,"Have both the Apple TV and now the fire. Picture quality is noticeably better with fire, as advertised. The only issue is the organization of the home screen could use some work, but overall, worth the money",positive

8628,4.0,"Runs awesome for a good amount of time. Unfortunately sometimes the device disconnects or asks to be refreshed, during that time the remote does not work and it is frozen on that screen.

8648,5.0,Works great and KODI is totally worth the price becaus you save a lot on not having to use Netflix anymore,positive
8649,5.0,"Upon using a few other android devices, I settled on this. The software is perfect, snappy, and overall awesome. Very easy to set up, just sign into your Amazon account.

8655,5.0,Works great with so many options. Haven't been able to get the 4k to work but that might be the hdmi cable currently connected. Everythings wotks extremely fast.,positive
8656,4.0,It's awesome being able to have 4K capability and being able to play games but it does get laggy at times.,positive
8657,5.0,"Love the Fire TV. It is fast and reliable. I have all my movies, tv shows and apps in one place.",positive

8662,5.0,"I have never been a fan of ""smart"" tvs, the interfaces of the best are terrible...The firetv interface is clean, fast and does what i want with relatively little fuss. These are a little more money than the firetv sticks, but much faster and have USB ports for wireless keyboards",positive
8663,5.0,"Bought this for my other tv which has an Amazon fire tv stick, world of difference as the fire tv is so much faster, buffering no problem",positive
8664,5.0,The Amazon Fire Stick is an amazing device that makes it easy to watch movies and navigate through apps - I love the fact that I don't even have to use my smart TV apps because the fire stick has it all. I would definitely recommend.,positive
8665,5.0,If you're looking to stop being ripped off by cable and satellite companies the combo of the antenna and fire tv are perfect!,positive
8666,4.0,I have this and I also have a Roku in my den. They both have their pros and cons. I do not use the remote which came with it. I use my harmony remotes to control the devices. I also have an echo. I like the front end on the Fire TV better than the Roku. The biggest con for me is the Fire TV doesn't have the VUDU app.,positive
8667,5.0,I love how fast it goes from one program to another program I like the apps that it has on it and also I like that is able to work with all my televisions that will problem.,positive
8668,5.0,The fire tv works well with ethernet. Not so much with wifi,positive

8684,3.0,"I found the Fire TV to be a good box for streaming, but not great. Two things that stood out is the low internal drive space and so so speed.I would recommend it, with a clear understanding of the short falls.",negative
8685,4.0,"Nice. Processor power was never a problem with the original Fire TV, so for streaming purposes, the new chip mainly serves to support 4K Ultra HD playback. Provided you have a 4K TV with an HDCP 2.2-enabled HDMI port, along with a fast Internet connection (Amazon recommends 15Mbps), you can stream Ultra HD content from either Amazon Video or Netflix. The Fire TV even labels Ultra HD content from Amazon video on the home screen, so you can quickly jump in.",positive
8686,5.0,Very happy with the performance of the fire tv. I also have first gen fire stick and the load time and lack of buffering on the fire tv is great. I'm also a prime member and the quantity of programming is pretty god. Would definitely recommend.,positive

8692,5.0,Love my fire tv so easy to use gives me all my services in one place,positive
8693,5.0,What else can I say? I can finally watch 4K content on my TV. The firetv is ever bit as good as the firestick.,positive
8694,5.0,good quality product will buy again best buy always has what i need,positive
8695,4.0,Bought a firestick and the box the same day. The box has larger memory so I don't have to worry about clearing my cache as often.,positive
8696,5.0,"Purchased this and the fire stick, this definitely showed a better picture quality and response compared to the stick. 4K imagine isn't bad at all and would consider this a good deal.",positive
8697,5.0,This product was just as expected. Will order more.,positive
8698,4.0,So far it has done exactly what I want it to do. It is much faster than the fire stick,positive
8699,5.0,Grateful I have the hottest item of the year and it works great! Thank you Best Buy!,positive
8700,5.0,Great for streaming media and other online things. No lag since you can connect it with a cord instead of over Wi-Fi if you are having lag issues.,positive
8701,5.0,"This is my first streaming TV device and I am new to the technology. It was very easy to set up and configure, taking only a few minutes. It worked like a charm! I then downloaded Kodi onto the device, following a youtube instructional video. While Kodi takes a little more patience and time, once installed, it is an awesome supplement to the Fire TV. Between the built-in service offerings and the vast amount of free streaming services offered via Kodi, this device is a 100% winner!!! No more cable and satellite TV subscriptions for this person!!",positive
8702,4.0,I was surprised with the quality of this product and although is true it doesn't have as many apps as Roku is still excellent.,positive
8703,5.0,If your tv is not a smart tv and you don't have a gaming system this is the appliance for you! Easy installation and very portable so you don't even see it!,positive
8704,5.0,I got this box's for a gift and they love it and for that price can't beat that,positive
8705,5.0,Ready to buy another pleased with item overall easy to use,positive
8706,4.0,This provides better sound than the built in Samsung TV sound but not as good as a full surround sound system. I liked the fact it had a digital audio connection to the TV and it comes with the cable.,positive
8707,5.0,I purchased my Fire TV to replace a Fire Stick and I am VERY HAPPY with my decision. So far I have not experienced any lag and it is so nice to be able to plug an ethernet cable into my Fire TV .,positive
8708,4.0,Little bit of learning curve but love it now. Probably will buy fire stick for other tv.,positive
8709,4.0,"I may have set my expectations a little too high. This replaced a dedicated htpc, but I will probably swap it back and attach it to the garage tv.",positive
8710,4.0,I definitely recommend getting this amazon tv over just the fire stick. It does a much better job of running all apps over the stick.,positive
8711,5.0,EXCELLENT PRODUCT IT SAVES YOU MONEY ON WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOWS AND SPORTS AND MOVIES .,positive
8712,4.0,I have this and I bought this for the gift of my brother-in-law and I am really glad to see the smile in his face. It works great and it is good for a movie fan.,positive
8713,5.0,"Picture is top-notch...4K capable. Also, something I discovered on my own that the ""experts"" in the stores did not know or tell me: even though you don't have a 4K capable TV, the Fire Box may still be what you want instead of the Fire Stick...here's why: when you watch live news or sports they are broadcast at 30 frames per second. The Fire Stick only can produce 20 frames per second, so the picture looks somehow ""previously recorded""...jusy not like a sharp, high-def pucture. So I replaced the Fire Stick on my 1080p capable TV with the Fire Box and, BINGO!, perfect...because it can reproduce 30 frames per second! You'll see the difference, trust me!!!",positive
8714,5.0,The Amazon Fire Tv is simply awesome. It has over 50 apps for watching tv shows and movies. There is nothing that this thing does not have when it comes to streaming apps.,positive
8715,5.0,Love the fire tv. Easy to set up and easy to use. Great quality content and streaming,positive

8717,5.0,It down strings very well works very well with our direct Now TV would recommend this product,positive
8718,5.0,The amazon fire tv is great in all aspects and is so fast,positive
8719,5.0,Defiantly worth upgrading from the fire stick does not freeze nor does it get hot and need a cool down time.,positive
8720,5.0,Great features and easy to use. A must buy for Prime members.,positive
8721,5.0,This streamer box is very easy to set up. It finds the WiFi quickly. A nice and enjoyable addition to cord cutting.,positive
8722,3.0,"It's so hard to decide If i should recommend this device or not. It's super fast, gorgeous images processing when paired up with my Sony 4k. However, it doesn't have turn off button. You have to make it ""sleep"" to turn it off, or else they will keep turning on and keep draining your wifi resource. Too simplistic controller make it hard to type. No option to sign in and out of an app. You have to wipe the app clean or reinstall the app to sign into another account. These can be easily fixed with better software.",negative
8723,5.0,"Great streaming device with a lot of options to watch, highly recommended and super easy to install and use",positive
8724,1.0,Tried setting this up on 2 TV's using both WIFI and Ethernet for hours. Could never get a signal. A total waste of time.,negative
8725,4.0,"Bought this at Best Buy only because Amazon was out of stock. Does 4k video, tons of apps that support it. Just make sure that your cable company is on the list of providers for standalone apps, e.g. HBO Go, Discovery, History, Travel Channel etc, else you'll find yourself not able to watch their specific content on this box. Bought it mainly because I use Playstation Vue to stream content and hate the tile setup on Roku. PS Vue on the Fire TV is a timeline setup, I prefer this much more than the Roku setup. Great box, works flawlessly with Alexa and Prime memberships. IMO, worth the $90, plus I got a free 30 day trial of Sling. Although I think the Sling trial is a con more than a pro hahaha!",positive
8726,4.0,I always purchase the fire sticks til someone told me to try the fire boxWish I would have done it first. Love it. Much betterSpeed faster,positive
8727,5.0,The Amazon - Fire TV is easy to learn and wonderful customer service they will walk you throw any thing you need help with.,positive
8728,5.0,The picture quality is great. It's easy to use and great for my home.,positive
8729,2.0,"Purchased Amazon Fire TV due to previous reviews stating that it performs fast with PlayStation Vue. Tried it out for a month and all it did was constantly buffer. Checked my internet speed and router/modem and I have the fastest 1GB speed available. Reviews on PlayStation Vue state that Roku interface is not as good, so I purchased Amazon Fire Stick to determine if it has better performance. Love the Amazon Fire Stick. Extremely fast and no buffering with online streaming with PlayStation Vue on the Amazon Fire Stick. Save your money and get the stick.",negative
8730,5.0,Very good product. Works well with all televisions.,positive
8731,5.0,Works great when connected directly to wifi router.,positive
8732,5.0,The box is better than the stick must have for anyone that likes to stream,positive
8733,5.0,Go ahead and spend the extra for the FireTV. Worth every penny spent.,positive
8734,4.0,"The FireTV is definitely faster than the Firestick and the performance is most noticeable when navigating across both native and third party menus. Relative to the Roku, the amazon user interface is lacking and a bit cumbersome to navigate. But all that doesn't really matter if you're getting it for the same reason I did--Kodi.",positive
8735,5.0,An excellent product. You can stream everything on it.,positive
8736,5.0,Good product would recommend to buy it to family and friends.,positive
8737,5.0,No joke I have one on every tv in my house.This unit is so powerful and *customizable.The content of movies and tv shows that you can stream is almost unlimited these days.,positive
8738,4.0,overall good but voice control does not work yet. support is not easily obtained to resolve the issue - it still does not work,positive
8739,4.0,"I'm a Prime member, so this was a no-brainer. Wish you could get the ""pirates"" version like the stock though.",positive

8743,4.0,"This tv box works great!!! Easy to play, and good quality",positive
8744,5.0,"Amazon Fire TV works very well with the Sony Play Vue. I purchased a second unit for another TV. The response time is quick and the Alexa voice search so quick and good its beyond good. I do not use the WiFi function although I have a Wifi in the house, instead I have a Ethernet cable plugged in for both units. I would most certainly buy this unit again. Worth every penny I spent on it.",positive
8745,5.0,Hook-up and set up is simple. You are able to watch TV quickly after set up! I was pleasantly surprised by the app options. I no longer miss having satellite!,positive

I also have a Fire TV for the largest TV in the house, which is faster. Now that it is up and running, I am going to cancel my cable TV and just keep the internet service.",positive
8751,5.0,This is a far better product than the fire stick that I first started out with it is a lot faster at everything it does and it hardly ever buffers. I would recommend to spend the extra money and get the fire tv.,positive

8754,4.0,Works great easy to operate well worth we use it instead off cable tv,positive
8755,5.0,Works better than roku plus apps like psvue were developed with more love. Roku also had some strange problem with working on a tv that requires hdmi to dvi,positive
8756,5.0,This Amazon TV was very easy to set up. I really enjoy all the features that it has to offer. I find myself not watching cable TV as much because now I can pick and choose the type of programs I prefer to watch. The problem with cable TV other than the outrages high prices is that you are paying for channels that you never watch.,positive
8757,5.0,"Before buying the FireTV, I had the FireTV Sticks. In an effort to cancel my cable, I signed up for Sling TV.",positive
8758,5.0,there were so many movies to pick from and also so many tv shows to watch all in great quality.,positive

8761,5.0,Easy to use even my 6year old can do it! We use it on a daily basis to watch Netflix and play games on it!,positive
8762,4.0,Excellent product that does what it is built to do and that shows great movies. Purchase this product Roku and this is a much better product. Love that I can watch other streaming apps as well on this device.,positive
8763,5.0,"Amazon Fire TV is quick and easy to use, believe it has enhanced both the video and audio. It is a perfect combination with Amazon Prime. Received professional advice from Best Buy Associate, thanks!",positive

8766,3.0,There doesn't seem to be much for 4K programs. Hopefully more to come.,negative
8767,4.0,Nice product but does not always respond to voice commands which have to be repeated.,positive
8768,4.0,Works great in my entertainment setup. My only real complaint is that you can't control it directly using an Echo - currently using a Harmony Hub.,positive
8769,5.0,It work great the first time and just bought my 2nd for a different location. The cord is that much closer to being cut.,positive
8770,5.0,"We purchased a couple Amazon Firesticks first to facilitate cutting the cord. The Firesticks are ok for bedrooms or less used TVs, they just don't perform as well as the more powerful Amazon TV Box. I will be purchasing another one for the movie room. It's been great cutting the cord. But the one thing I'm waiting in is for Hulu Live to make it over to the Amazon platform. They keep saying soon, so patiently waiting. Hulu Live looks to be much better than our current Sling service. Other than that the box is great and that one issue might be Hulu or networks holding it up.",positive
8771,5.0,Got this item to watch movies.... has Netflix and most other places to watch movies and tv shows,positive
8772,5.0,it is a great product. I would recommend this to a friend,positive

8777,5.0,"It has a great picture. But, This is not different from the original fire stick.",positive
8778,5.0,"we love this Fire Tv, just hard to find shows for now.",positive
8779,4.0,"I didn't take the time to read the reviews on this as I actually went to the store to buy a Fire stick. The salesman talked me into the Fire tv instead supposedly because of higher picture quality. I haven't noticed any differences. For an average user, maybe the stick is just fine and you save money.",positive
8780,5.0,The Firestick is awesome! Would highly recommend to anyone for their tv.,positive
8781,4.0,"New smart tv, sound bar, and AlexaThe Fire brings it all together. Good product !!!",positive

8793,5.0,This box is better then the fire stick I can finally look at 4K movies with this box then I could look on the fire stick and it handles my internet very well which is 5.0ghz wifi no problem,positive
8794,5.0,The Fire TV works just like it is supposed to. I got it mostly to watch CBS all access and it worked so well I purchased a second one 1 week later for another TV.,positive

8804,4.0,"its ok, u have to buy all the subscriptions and sometimes half of them just buffer the whole time, I have very fast internet and its wired so idk whats up with it.",positive
8805,4.0,I love this. So many apps and the quality is compatible with a 4k TV. The only thing is sometimes the apps freeze and restart sometimes. This doesn't happen often though.,positive
8806,5.0,This was a major update from a smart DVD player. Much faster and easier to use.,positive
8807,5.0,I LIKE THE FIRE TV STREAMING MEDIA PLAYER. IT WORKS WELL.,positive
8808,5.0,"faster then the firestick tv version but not as portable, still a great product for streaming",positive

8814,5.0,I love it. These things are sold out everywhere. Except at BestBuy.,positive
8815,4.0,"I got this to go along with the Vizio P65-C1 I bought. The Vizio is a great display, but with no internal tuner. It must be connected to cable or a streaming/casting source for programing, The Fire TV makes it easy to connect to Netflix and Hulu, among many other program sources. But, it's especially great if you're a Prime member, giving you access to Prime Video, both free and purchased. The only think I'd change is if it could receive HDR programs/movies. Amazon Video does have HDR programming available for a growing amount of its content, but this version of Fire TV does not. If you don't have a UHD TV, Fire TV is about perfect.",positive
8816,5.0,I already own a firestick. I decided to buy this one for my 4k tv due to it supporting 4k. I moved my firestick to the bedroom tv. Great product!,positive
8817,5.0,Absolutely love it! Watch movies all the time. Great investment!,positive

8821,4.0,if you are a college student or just want to go and cut off your primary cable to save money go for it. It will have a little getting use to and everything isn't as clear as you would want it to be but it is definitely due able for watching tv shows and movies....,positive
8822,5.0,"Amazing fire TV is simple, works seamlessly. I like the streaming speed, and cache on the device. Amazon has lot choices interms of movie. Big bang for your buck.",positive
8823,5.0,So much more powerful and with an actual LAN connection the speeds are much better too. If you can afford it get the box over the stick.,positive
8824,5.0,This thing is much better than the fire stick version it's much more powerful and faster and the best part is you can connect it to the internet via ETHERNET CABLE.,positive
8825,5.0,Fast to install and I very easy to work it's got great resolution,positive
8826,5.0,I can watch anything I want on fire Tv. Best thing ever,positive
8827,5.0,"We did a lot of research when looking for a streaming device to use on an outside television as we didn't want to add another cable box. Amazon Fire TV was the best option. It is so convenient and easy to use. The voice commands are excellent. It also has several apps that are unavailable on Apple TV that we truly enjoy, such as TCM. It also has USB port available. We highly recommend Amazon Fire TV for anyone searching for a streaming device!",positive
8828,5.0,"Me and my wife used the fire stick to stream shows for over a year and recently upgraded our internet to a higher speed package. To take advantage of the new speeds I thought I'd get the fire TV to use the Ethernet port on the back. Not only does it stream the shows much faster and HD works much better now, but just clicking through the menus is so much nicer with no hesitation. If you are on the fence go with the fire tv and save yourself the upgrade later. Definitely worth it.",positive
8829,5.0,Need an alternative or supplement to Cable TV? This is it. There are many entertainment options with the FireTV. I can not sing its praises enough.,positive
8830,5.0,We love the amazon fire tv the 4K definition is great easy to use,positive
8831,4.0,"Since moving to the Fire TV, haven't missed DirecTV!! This a great product loaded with features that is very easy to use.",positive
8832,3.0,Works pretty good but it's slow or glitchy. Either way it's good for the price.,negative
8833,2.0,The Video quality on this is lacking compared to other streaming devices. In the plus side you can use kodi. I would get a roku if you don't plan on using kodI or a nividi shield if you plan on using kodi.,negative
8834,5.0,Outstanding! We Love everything about it and look forward to what comes next!,positive
8835,3.0,I have bought 3 of the amazon fire tv boxes. I love how many online services you can access via the fire. I would rate this a perfect 5 if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made. 2 of the 3 remotes died before the batteries did. Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done. And dont try to get help from Amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box.,negative
8836,5.0,"I was hesitant to upgrade from my original firestick to this, but I'm glad I did. It works much faster and smoother. Well worth the money.",positive
8837,5.0,I have really enjoyed binge watching shows on Netflix and exploring all the options I have with the fire stick.,positive

8845,5.0,Alexa thats all you need the voice command is amazing. Looking for shows or browsing,positive
8846,5.0,Previously had two Roku devices and ended up switching both to Fire TV's. Interface feels much better and apps seam to respond better on this than the Roku.,positive
8847,5.0,"I have no use for cable since purchasing this device. When used with subscriptions to amazon prime, sling, Hulu and Netflix, you forget you don't have cable. The stronger your wifi, the better your experience:",positive
8848,4.0,"I was hesitant at first to buy it. But now I use it daily. Definitely recommended if you have an Amazon prime account. You can watch movies and listen to music on here. I bought the fire tv instead of the stick for future use of 4k content. It also has a micro sd slot, usb port, and digital audio port. With the support of apps you can stream content from your home networked PCs also.",positive
8849,5.0,"My daughter had the fire stick at her home when I went to visit her , I liked it So when I got back home I went and bought the fire tv box due to it having more memory, it works great",positive
8850,4.0,The only concern is there is no filter on free apps. Also the parental control password is a bit cumbersome and enforcing on too many option rather than just not allowing new financial purchases.,positive
8851,5.0,I love the Amazon fire tv. I have so much access to television series and movies.,positive
8852,4.0,"I bought one from BestBuy instead of buying one that is jail-broke. That is a moral choice for me. That being said, I can add the apps I want. The hardest part so far is getting used to not having a DVR and not being able to fast fwd through commercials...but I'm saving over $100/ month over cable, including the $40/month of apps that I'm currently buying.",positive
8853,5.0,"This device is great to stream a variety of content. It does not buffer like the stick since it plugs into the Ethernet on the router. I would recommend for your ""streaming"" needs.",positive
8854,5.0,This thing is used everday. I had this guy Vincent program it with cody.he has been doing this for several years. Cable channels movies just like my direct Tv.,positive
8855,5.0,Perfect. Stream tv easy to use remote. Easy to set up,positive
8856,5.0,Between this and an hd antennae I cut cable and I am never going back!!,positive

8860,4.0,"In terms of mid-tier streaming devices, (Apple TV, Roku, etc.), I think the Amazon Fire TV is by far the best. The interface is neat and well designed, and the product has the most recent technology to allow for fast streaming over lower-tier streaming devices like the Chromecast or Fire Stick. In addition, I think the Amazon streaming devices offer better features for Prime members than what other devices can offer.",positive
8861,4.0,I like the Fire TV much better than the Fire Stick.,positive

8867,5.0,Hard wired as opposed to wireless. Easy to install. Much better than fire stick,positive
8868,5.0,I love this. I can load all my apps and watch pretty much everything I ever used to watch on cable. The only thing is I wish I could get the Hallmark channel...but other than that I'm very happy for the price.,positive
8869,5.0,This box is probably one of the best things that I've ever purchased!,positive

8879,4.0,"More than satisfied with my Amazon - Fire TV. I previously had a ""stick"" and gave it to my friend. This product is FAR SUPERIOR. I love that you can use a wireless mouse/keboard via USB port, and have the option using WiFi or an Ethernet cable for network connection. SO MUCH FASTER when hardwired. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE CHOOSE THIS... Definitely worth the couple xtra $$",positive

8904,5.0,"Fast processor, excellent interface. You need this if you are cutting the cord.",positive
8905,4.0,"I have tried numerous Media Streaming Devices, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. This particular steamer offers a solid combination of hardware, apps, settings and tweeks, as well as expansion options and upgrades all for a reasonable price. You can obviously stream media from the Internet but you can also play games, stream live TV, watch 4K content, add USB and/or SD storage for expansion and off-line access, connect a USB and/or Bluetooth keyboard/mouse/joystick for enhanced interaction, connect Bluetooth headphones or speaker(s) for added listening options, and more! Unless you're looking for a specific advanced feature or functionality, the Amazon Fire TV provides a solid overall Media Streaming experience!",positive
8906,4.0,"This is a great streaming box, and I enjoy the voice search option. However, I wish that the Amazon Fire tv when doing a search on the main screen would provide you the options of a movie or tv. show from apps that you have a subscription with and not just Amazon. Of course I can go into each and every app that I have a paid subscription with, but It would be nice to do a search from the main screen and display results across the board.",positive

8922,5.0,No need for a smart TV. Just pick you up one of these and you are set. I purchased a 4K TV which had limited apps but was 600 less than the one which supported the additional app I wanted (PLEX) so I opted for the TV I got with this FireTV and I was set.,positive

8925,5.0,"I found the Amazon Fire TV responds faster than the Amazon Fire Stick. Plus it has an ethernet port! On my setup, this helps out a lot since I have 8 Fire TVs running Plex. If all of those were on one WiFI AP it would probably kill the bandwidth. The Amazon Fire TV loads quickly and works as expected. The only thing I don't like is I wish I could customize the home screen so it would only show what I want it to.",positive

8957,4.0,"This nifty little device is perfect for freeing yourself from the clutches of the evil and nefarious clutches of the dreaded cable empire. No longer will you be subjected to their random price raises of their already high prices. No more will you fret over paying exorbitant fees for channels that you don't even watch!! Yes this firestick can and will open up, quite literally an entire new world of viewing for you. Set up is simple and quick. There are a multitude of different apps that u can use to take complete control over what u want to watch and pay for. I'm not going to go into specifics about how to watch everything you want because we all have different interests. A simple google search will help guide you with those specifics. But just know that for financial freedom from contracts and corporate giants this is the way to go. One downside I will mention is the buffering. Ensure you have a good internet connection. This is a requirement for the device to work. Make sure u keep the device free of any unecessary apps which will take up its HD. Also ensure you have a router that is worth while. Personally I ended up going with the firebox instead of the stick because I wanted the best connection possible and as we all know that requires hard wiring of your device. So if u want to replace cable for your main living room tv area go with the box. For kids or something get them the stick.",positive

8984,4.0,"This Fire TV is a better choice than the Fire Stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a LAN connection or if you have potential wireless connections. It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership.",positive
8985,5.0,We enjoy looking at movies and other shows on our New toy.,positive

8997,5.0,"Cord cutter here. We had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone. Since we are Prime members, we finally decided to give Amazon Fire TV a shot. We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner. Since we use Prime and Amazon Music, its a no-brainer for us to use the Fire TV. Everything syncs automatically and transfers from device to device seamlessly.Edited to add the following section after reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews:If you are a first-time cord-cutter, considering cord-cutting or new to streaming TV services, here are a few things to keep in mind.1) Make sure you really take the time to do research and due-diligence on cord-cutting. Just google ""cord cutting"" to get started with several good articles. I'm seeing a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for things like Netflix, Hulu, etc. Fire TV (and all of the other streaming services like Roku, Apple TV, etc.) do not just give you free access to all content. They allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for as opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channels you will never watch. If you do it right, you'll have access to the content you want for a substantial savings over what you were paying with cable.2) Make sure you have a strong (and fast) internet connection. This is very important. We dumped our cable company in its entirety (including internet service) and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another company. We have up to six devices simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that as well as the streaming Fire TV. So make sure yours can as well. If you're not sure, call your internet service provider, tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speeds.3) Some apps require a cable subscription. You can purchase a streaming service like Sling which will bundle several of the channels you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps. For now password sharing with one of your friends may solve that problem but I suspect its only a matter of time before that loophole gets closed. So do your research and make sure you can access the channels you want.4) Give yourself time to adjust to the new interface. It took some getting used to when I lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide. But the fact is, I'm no longer wasting large chunks of time mindlessly surfing the guide. Rather than surf, I'm turning to specific apps to watch specific programs. Its liberating in a way that I didn't expect. Besides, I can now surf all of the Amazon Prime content by simply using the voice command on the remote.",positive

Wookie a free build info found on YouTube or BeausBuild a paid build info found on FB or local to OKC. We are running both. One on this model and one on the gaming edition. Currently Amazon shows the gaming edition unavailable but we have been on a mad hunt for one more because it is faster and comes with a game controller making operation much easier.

9111,5.0,After reviewing all of the brands out there. I decided on the fireTv box.,positive

9117,5.0,Differently recommend. Easy to install and ease of use.,positive
9118,5.0,Tons of things you can do with this. Highly recommend it.,positive
9119,4.0,I bought my fire tv last month and I like it sofar. I can use alexa on remote control not even to search in tv programs I can ask every question. for some reason YouTube app isn't installed by default and there is no web browsing app installed by default. The default country address is Turkey and if you don't change it you can not install some apps because of restrictions!!! Installing apps is tricky for some apps. I think it'd be nice to have more flexibility on software aspects of this device. Other than that I like everything about it.,positive
9120,5.0,A great way to start cutting the cable cord. Might have to buy another.,positive
9121,5.0,"This replaced an original fire stick. It works good enough for us to cancel our cable tv. If it's not Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, or the antenna we don't need to see it.",positive

9125,5.0,Amazon fire has made a great product with this one!,positive
9126,5.0,I got this to try out cutting the cable. Being an Amazon Prime member I knew that I had some content already available but there are so many options when you get to looking. I really like the Ethernet port that I can hard wire from my modem to make sure that I am running at max speeds.,positive
9127,5.0,"The Amazon Fire TV is a tiny, premium quality box that connects to any TV with an HDMI cable & provides the most intuitive & powerful interface for Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu & many more.LIKES: 1- Small, unobtrusive size 2- User friendly remote 3- Internal memory is 2Gb Flash, 16Gb Storage + Micro SD Card slot that accommodates up to 128Gb external storage! 4- Ethernet or WiFi connected. Ethernet will provide a more robust signal than WiFi, to reduce the buffering so commonly seen on lesser boxes. 5- Very easy to use6- Beautiful on screen interface / graphics7- 4K Ultra HD capable 8- You can download and save apps, movies & music on the optional external storage card 9- Voice Search on the Remote lets you speak a movie, actor, title, etc. & let the search begin!10- Alexa can search your photos & can even look for a specific individual in the photos by name DISLIKES: None! COMPARE to AMAZON FIRE STICK: The Fire Stick is a very inexpensive device that is WiFi only & has 1/2 the Flash & Memory as this Fire TV. It has no provision to add additional memory. The Fire TV connects with Ethernet cable or WiFi. Ethernet provides a much faster & stronger signal, so your movies don't freeze up. With 2X the Flash & Memory of Fire Stick + an external memory slot, the Fire TV makes skipping & frozen movies a thing of the past. CONCLUSION: I recommend a Fire TV for every HDTV you own! It is truly an amazing device & converts your existing TV, whether a Smart TV or not, to a VERY Smart TV!",positive

9272,5.0,"Great little device it reacts fast to the remote and is faster than the fire stick, if you thinking about getting one get the fire TV instead of the stick.",positive
9273,4.0,"I enjoy being able to view all the online videos that are out there. This allows me to view everything I could imagine with the added ability to view videos that I have ripped from my dvd collection. I didn't give it a 5 because I can only figure out how to view movies on the Micro SD card not the included USB connection and it tends to abort after an hour or so on a couple of movies I wanted to watch. Not sure why, others are fine.",positive
9274,4.0,Better performance and clarity than the Amazon fire stick.,positive
9275,4.0,Very pleased with this product after downloading Kodiak and the Exodus add-ons. Since then I have added numerous add-ons just like getting apps from an app store. It's well worth the cost and I haven't even bothered to maximize the potential of this little critter yet.,positive

9277,5.0,"I had been researching ways to forego using cable television in the future and it seems this was good start. Haven't quite figured it all out yet but so far, so good.",positive
9278,5.0,The Fire TV was easy to set-up and we have had no problems. I do suggest unplugging when not in use as the box does heat up...just to be safe.,positive

9280,5.0,This unit with amazon prime is a blast! Use it to have fun dance parties...,positive
9281,5.0,"WE PURCHASED THIS IN PLACE OF PAYING THE SKY HIGH CABLE PRICES FOR CHANNELS THAT WE JUST DO NOT USE. OUR TV IS A ROKU SMART TV, BUT WE FOUND THAT WE STILL NEEDED THIS TO GAIN ACCESS TO A FEW STATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH OUR PURCHASE.",positive
9282,5.0,I'm really impressed by the amount of expansion you can put in with a micro SD card for extra storage .,positive
9283,5.0,"Bottom Line: You can stream TV from anywhere. This allows you to bring HD Television Home. Become an Amazon Prime member, its worth it. Prime allows Movies, Music and Shows into your handheld device and home. Never miss your favorite programs.",positive

9288,5.0,"THE FIRE TV WAS SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO USE CABLE OR SATELLITE AND IT""S WORKING.",positive
9289,5.0,"The Amazon Fire TV is definitely one of the top media streamers on the market today. It allows for 4K playback which only a few other devices can do, ethernet port to get the most reliable streaming speed, and an expandable external storage port so you will have plenty of room for all of your apps. If you are will to pay a little extra for this it is definitely going to be worth it in the end",positive
9290,5.0,"So far so good,no problems and would recommend to everyone. Has crisp clear pictures and easy to navigate around without help or instruction manual.",positive
9291,5.0,I'm very excited to say I love my fire stick. I've waited for this a long time. My neighbors say they are so happy,positive
9292,4.0,It's fast compared to the Firestick. The only issue I see is the remote becomes unresponsive sometimes.,positive
9293,4.0,easy to install. very nice but hopefully it will be cheaper.,positive
9294,5.0,"After having been an Apple TV user (the older versions, of which I have 2) I decided to go with the amazon product because this one supports fox sports. That's the only reason I chose it. But after using it I have no complaints at all. I haven't yet looked into streaming from mobile device to it yet, not sure if it's possible or not. Either way I'd recommend this to anyone looking to buy one of these devices.",positive
9295,5.0,I like the product work vey well and I am very happy with it.,positive
9296,4.0,Bought to use Sling. It works decent. Glitches sometimes but overall worth it.,positive

9298,5.0,Did everything I wanted. Definitely need a good Internet connection,positive
9299,5.0,"I reviewed many similar products to help with our cord cutting. For it's price and good reviews from many independent reviewers it is the best for the money and easy to set up and you. It has such a wide variety of apps, you can get more than what you get on cable for less.",positive

9304,5.0,Amazing thing instead of cable has amazing apps and cable programs for lower cost,positive
9305,5.0,Everything on fire stick is awesome and I love it.,positive
9306,5.0,"I was using a Roku Ultra for awhile, but I found that I've been using the Fire T.V more and more. There's really nothing wrong with the Roku but I seem to like the Fire T.V more. Probably because you can side load Kodi on it ;)",positive
9307,5.0,Best streaming box on the market hands down. Bar none,positive
9308,5.0,Best thing since sliced bread. I'd give 10 stars if I could.,positive

9310,5.0,It works wonderfully. Works faster than the first generation.,positive
9311,4.0,"I had purchased an Apple TV, most recent generation, and hated it. The touch screen was too touchy, and ultimately it just never functioned properly so I returned it (to Costco). Instead, I bought this product because it had all of the online channels (except Apple TV but who cares) and it has Alexa, which frankly is better than Siri (and I say that despite being very pro Apple).",positive

9313,5.0,I have an Apple TV and The Amazon fire dreaming fire station much more.,positive
9314,5.0,Love this device! Processor is fast enough to stream Netflix & Hulu without buffering but also has enough memory for the kids to download games and pandora and their apps that the love. Pay the extra $$$ and get a quality streaming device.,positive
9315,5.0,"I'm currently living in Korea and needed American television to keep me entertained. I had Kodi installed on a FireStick, however, despite having a 100Mbps service plan, my wireless connection couldn't keep up with the bandwidth hungry programming. My solution was to purchase the FireTV and hardwire my internet connection via ethernet. The difference was immediately noticeable, I haven't had any buffering issues and programs load up immediately. I would definitely recommend this device if you live in an apartment where the air is saturated with WIFI signals and plan on using bandwidth heavy applications such as Kodi. The ethernet connection ensures that you are getting a clean signal and using the maximum bandwidth speed of your ISP.",positive
9316,5.0,So far this has been a great product for us. We've been able to cancel our uverse and still watch al of our favorite shows.,positive
9317,5.0,"Good product, easy to set up and to use! I purchased it to have DTV Now on a 2nd tv and I received a Apple box from DTV , I like the Amazon box better than the Apple box , more user friendly.",positive

9321,5.0,"Love it, had the stick and it was kinda slow navigating. This one is much faster. Was going to use this and cancel cable. When I told my cable company I wanted to cancel and I was just going to stream everything they cut my bundle cost by $100. I kept cable but I also still use my firetv alot.",positive
9322,5.0,The stick offers one of the best options if your trying to ween off the cable providers. Great offers,positive

9335,5.0,"I have a smart tv but the speed with which the apps work leaves a lot to be desired. I bought the Amazon Fire tv because having Amazon prime allows me to watch tons of shows and movies for free and the selection of available apps is great. The only drawback I noticed is that Vudu cannot be installed but I do have that on my smart tv so it's not a big issue. The remote of the Fire tv works via bluetooth so the box can be hidden away and out of sight which is great. Overall, a very solid streaming box.",positive
9336,4.0,"Excellent. Nice solution to non smart device. If you use with a smart tv, the tv remote will also run Amazon TV. We use it with a projector and usb audio for the sound.",positive
9337,5.0,"The Amazon fire TV is perfect for those looking to cut the cord. It can connect through wifi or through an ethernet cable, which works awesome and I don't get buffering. Plus 4k streaming, better processor and more memory is an upgrade compared to the Fire Stick. I ended up cancelling my DirectTV a while ago and haven't looked back. Compared to what I was paying with satellite subscription, this is very cheap. I already have Amazon Prime, so I get their streaming service and also have Netflix and Hulu. This is perfect for my family and my needs .",positive
9338,5.0,Purchased this Fire TV box mainly to watch PlayStation Vue and it works perfectly with the service. Amazon Prime works great too as expected. No buffering or lag while streaming. Highly recommended.,positive

9340,5.0,I love this product it is well worth the money that I paid for it.,positive
9341,3.0,Its an okay product. It is geared towards amazon users. Doesn't have apps that roku or apple tv have. I got it for the direct now and it froze every time I used it.,negative
9342,5.0,This thing is AWE... wait for it... SOME. Don't like cable? Buy this thing immediately!,positive
9343,5.0,"great response time, image quality is fantastic, easy to navigate",positive

9346,5.0,you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search function.,positive
9347,5.0,I'm an Amazon Prime & Netflix costumer and I just love this thing. I no longer have Comcast TV only antenna and two Fire TV's. Absolutely love it. It's fast as long as my internet is good.,positive

9353,4.0,Great product use it every day to watch movies and tv shows,positive
9354,5.0,I had an Amazon Fire Stick for the house before I bought the Fire TV. I wanted to get rid of cable and just stream. The Fire TV is fast and you barely see any buffer or lag.

9361,5.0,"I've had a Roku and Apple TV, and also used an XBox One to access services such as Netflix. The Amazon Fire is the best I've used so far. Simple, clean, attractive interface. Very responsive. Since I'm an Amazon Prime member it made sense to look at this when it was time to upgrade. Love it.",positive
9362,5.0,Not much can be added to the already substantial positive reviews. I bought both the Fire TV and Fire Stick so I'll comment on that. The Fire TV is much quicker and love the ability to run Ethernet and USB right to the unit. The Fire stick is great for our bedroom but this Fire TV is best for main TV viewing.,positive
9363,3.0,"Looking for a streaming media box? This is a fine android based one..it has an Ethernet port, streams, does 1080p, Amazon, and if you have all android stuff it's fine..I really don't like that it doesn't have a volume control..the only difference between this and the fire stick (for me) is the internal storage capacity, and the Ethernet port..so but two fire sticks instead of one box, unless you want to play the apps",negative
9364,5.0,"Performs much better than our old Roku and the Firestick! Seems to be way faster, much clearer w/ no buffering issues. I just wish it came with a qwerty keyboard.",positive
9365,5.0,The Fire TV box works great. We were looking for a device that streams DirecTV Now and this device was significantly less than a competing device that offered the service. We liked the first one so much we bought a second one.,positive

9397,5.0,Enjoyed the firesticks for a while but was tired of how much buffering time it took because of Wifi. Spending the extra $40 to plug this directly into the modem was well worth it. Haven't had a buffering issue at all. 1080P full movies load and play in a matter of seconds!!,positive

9421,5.0,Works great. Was easy to set up and has great quality output and plenty of apps that can run on it Only complaint is too much focus on Amazon content.,positive
9422,5.0,FireTV is intuitive and fast. We had both a FireTV and a Fire Stick. We returned the Fire Stick because it seemed to lag a lot. Both FireTV units work well. It allows us to use PlayStation Vue as our primary live TV. A combination of PS Vue and free over the air TV (OTA with indoor antenna) allowed us to cut the cable. We did upgrade our internet as Centurylink offered a free upgrade to 40 mbps. This eliminated buffering on programs when multiple units were in use. We are very happy with the quality of picture and the channels. We will save a lot of money over time and the TV experience is great. We also like the free On Demand programming. Very pleased with this product.,positive

9427,2.0,The fire tv does not display in 4k.. it processes in 4k but cant display 4k.. This is because of the dumb design.. It still has a 1.14 HDMI port.. you need at least a 2.0 dvd port to receive a 4k signal.. You wont be able to tell until you hit your tv display resolution.. there you will see it still displaying in 1080p.,negative
9428,5.0,Excellent streaming box - Easy to setup & Use! Performs great either hard wired or running on Wi-Fi. There are both free apps and paid apps to help save on cable costs! Works perfect with your Amazon Prime membership! Would totally recommend!,positive

9444,5.0,"Have only been using the Amazon TV for a few months now and so far have been very satisfied. Simple to use, it walks you through the setup and provides access to lots of apps and streaming video services.",positive
9445,5.0,"We purchased 2 of these for a couple of reasons. One because we were already Amazon Prime members and the other was paying too much for cable TV. Weve had them now for approx a month (one in the living room and one in the bedroom) and they work flawlessly. Easy set up (again if you're a Prime Member, just follow the on screen directions. We also subscribed to Sling TV for those channels we still wanted and purchased an outdoor antenna for locals. Fire TV has all the apps ready so they make it easy to set up what you want to watch. It can take a little getting used to apps instead of the TV guide on cable but if you have a smart phone its very similar. The Fire TV will not work with a standard IR remote so you have to use their remote provided but if you want to use only one remote for everything then I highly recommend the Logitech hub system that will control everything including the Fire TV. I have a TV, Blue Ray, Fire TV all connected through HDMI in my receiver and only have to use the one Logitech remote. Make sure you get the hub system since it works with IR, RF and blue tooth. Once everything is set up the Logitech hub app lets you control your system through your smart phone so there's no need to purchase more remotes. By the way, im not an employee of Best Buy, Logitech or Amazon just an electronics freak, but like things simple. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and won't go back to cable TV.

9449,5.0,"The way Amazon has set up their software is pretty great, they make it easy to get connected to your hulu, hbogo, netflix or whatever streaming service you have.

9500,5.0,"It is hard to beat this box. It is fast, has hardware acceleration for H264 and H265 (up to 4k) video, so it doesn't stutter, even with the highest quality videos. Android based OS easily sideloads apps like Kodi (SPMC) and Firefox browser. The remote is comfortable to use and is actually much easier to use than the current Apple TV (4th gen) remote. Having a microSDHC slot makes up for the dismal 8GB of internal storage. USB slot makes use of a standard wireless keyboard easy. I wish the homepage was more organized/customizeable like the AppleTV, but the apps and hardware itself is every bit as good IMO.",positive

Much faster and also has SD Card inputs. We use it for Kodi and it's much faster than the firetvstick I programmed for others.,positive
9519,5.0,"Simple to set up, worth the expense, fully compatible and works fairly well with xfinity comcast.",positive
9520,5.0,a great item to be able to stream tv/sports/movies without needing to pay a cable company for their services.,positive

9651,4.0,Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that there's no separate profiles yet.,positive
9652,5.0,"We ditched cable TV and went to Play Station Vue On a PS4. Two other TV's needed a way to watch Vue. Reviews said the Fire TV would do it, and it does it well. I agree with those who said ""In some ways it does it better."" There is a learning curve on the remote. For example, the upper right button gives you the Programing Guide icon with a quick press. After you have selected a 2nd program, that same button, with a longer press lets you jump back to Last program. Start up is a lot quicker than the PS4. If you also have Amazon Prime, the combination becomes a real bargain",positive
9653,5.0,For the price it should come with a hdmi & wireless keyboard.,positive

9664,5.0,"The Amazon Fire TV system was very easy to set up. I was actually surprised at how little the box was, and just how awesome the apps and downloadable games were that you can be use on the Amazon Fire TV. I ordered all my Amazon Fire TV apps online at Amazon and Google Play Store. I am an Amazon Prime and Google Play Store member. I bought this for one reason, and that's Kodi, it's an awesome app for Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick, and for the sd card reader on Amazon Fire TV it's easy to install and get up and running. The Fire TV doesn't have any issues that I can't fix, and the controls and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth. Also the voice control works wonderfully. Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to cut the cable.",positive

9683,4.0,We have a Roku device and was wanting another device for another room and after reading the reviews we decided on the Amazon Fire TV.

Twice the speed of the firestick with availability to add external hard drives and memory cards. Bluetooth enables you to add keyboards and game controllers if you wish. Also has an ethernet port so you don't have to use WiFi. I absolutely love it and if I had the choice I would buy a fire tv box rather than a firestick.,positive

The Vue is the only subscription (about $35 month) that offered NFL NETWORK, SEC, and ESPN with DVR like capabilities...PlayStation offers a cloud service included. Minor issues with the app. So far it is definitely worth it. I suggest researching which channels PlayStation Vue offers to compare with what you currently watch.

9788,5.0,"It's fantastic! All my photo albums, movie purchases, Amazon prime movies in one place.",positive
9789,2.0,"I bought this to go with the Toshiba 4K TV with built-in Chromecast I bought from Best Buy. It's nice when it works but I had problems with it that caused me to return it.I have a Fire Stick and it works great. I leave it plugged in but it needs to be unplugged every few weeks, otherwise it works fairly well. The Fire TV had to be unplugged after every use. The screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound. If I left it plugged in for any amount of time, then it would not work well. I liked the voice search on it and Alexa works great. You can ask for the weather, play music, and presumably other things that the Echo, Dot, and Tap can do. Just a side note, you have to keep the button pressed when asking Alexa to do something.Maybe I had a defective unit, maybe it was something else. But I've had a Paperwhite and a Voyage that both died on me in similar ways. I've never had a problem with the lower end Kindles or Fire tablets. Based on my limited experience, Amazon just doesn't get its higher end products right. I'm still going to use Amazon for a variety of things, but I no longer trust them for the higher end products that they make and sell.",negative
9790,5.0,"The Amazon - Fire TV with Alexa Voice Remote is a great product. The setup is easy. I do advise you to set up an Amazon account prior to make the setup easy. I am an Amazon Prime Member, but it's not necessary to use the fireTV. I also purchased the fireTV stick for a 2nd bedroom. I will tell you though, the FireTV is worth the extra money. Not only is the FireTV still small, but it has 4k definition and you can use Ethernet and Wi-Fi. The biggest difference between this and the Fire Stick is that fireTv has expandable memory, excellent to add photos, apps, movies etc. The app store on the device also has games you can play on the fire tv and for an extra $40 you can get a remote that looks like an xbox controller.",positive
9791,5.0,"This is a wonderful way to cut the cable cord! We have Amazon Prime, so our Viewing membership is paid, and there are so many TV show series/movies to watch, especially with Kodi loaded on the unit. We rounded it out with an inexpensive Sling membership, which gives us the live TV we need for current news and network shows. We are saving so much on our cable bill and couldn't be happier with our viewing experience!",positive
9792,4.0,"There are a few things I like about the device. I like the remote. I like that I have access to Amazon Prime (video and music). I like that Direct TV Now is available. However, there are a few things that need to improve on the Fire TV. One, I've had more buffering issues on this device than I have had on my Apple TV or Roku box. Two, Alexa is a joke. Very little that she actually does. Three, the App Store is not as vast as other services.",positive

9826,4.0,"Take out the box from packaging, connect box, turn on the box and watch Amazing Amazon tv just like that.....any easier and easier or convenient it can not get. Great buy at Best But.",positive
9827,5.0,"I bought this because the PlayStation Vue interface is the same as what you see on Sony PlayStation. But while I was having al sorts of problem with PlayStation running PlayStation Vue, I didn't encounter any of the sameProblems when using FireTV. It's like when Oracle GoldenGate was working better with Sybase database than with Oracle. :-)I will wait for newer version of FireTV for my other TVs.FireTV is the best streaming device for PlayStation Vue.",positive
9828,5.0,"Amazon fire tv has faster processor and more memory than firestick which makes the guide and navigation much faster, have sling tv app installed and scrolling through menus etc is really fast. Would recommend this to other people considering amazon firestick to choose this instead.",positive

9833,5.0,"Great system, one of the best android box out there.",positive
9834,5.0,"I got this over the Roku Ultra which is 4K compatible, Roku was garbage. The amazon fire tv is a must if you have a Amazon account. Its a great streamer, I have no buffering problems.",positive
9835,5.0,"Works awesome...especially the 4K content. This was an upgrade from an original fire tv box, and works better than the old one.",positive
9836,5.0,"I also have a firestick but I gave the fire tv a try cause it's supposed to be faster and I can connect an Ethernet cable to it, and it delivered.",positive
9837,5.0,If you are up in the air between the two (fire stick and fire TV) go with the TV due to the speed alone.. The memory is also nice but you will have a more enjoyable experience with the fire TV. I have them both in my house but prefer the Fire TV...,positive
9838,5.0,I had been using Fire stick which 1080P cabable. When I bought Fire TV then I saw the difference. It can stream 4K content. It comes with plenty of free apps and now I always have many options to watch. Great product.,positive
9839,4.0,"I own Apple TV,Google Chromecast, Roku and now a Amazon Fire TV. This is great product for Amazon products. If you are looking for the ultimate media player get the Roku. If you are a heavy Apple fan get a Apple TV, if you use Amazon, buy this.They each have their good and bad. I do not like the Apple TV. I only use it for itunes and mirroring my mac. The Amazon fire is great because you can download android apps. It doesn't have as many tv apps as the Roku, but its pretty easy to add 3rd party apps.",positive
9840,5.0,"I have two, one for each TV in the house. I don't even use my Apple TV anymore since I can also play HBO go and Nefflix on Amazon TV and there are several Amazon only shows (sort of like having another Netflix account)",positive

9847,5.0,"This thing is awesome, I had a firestick and then I upgraded to the FireTV and it is much faster and much smoother. It is a 2015 model and I am not sure if it will be upgraded in the near future but it is pretty decent in 2017. Also much easier and user friendly than the Apple TV also cheaper,",positive
9848,5.0,Easy to maneuver through the various channels. This could replace my Satellite co.,positive
9849,5.0,Love this TV box does everything and even more. Everyone needs one.,positive
9850,5.0,This fire tv is an excellent streaming device. One of the best things about it is it is able to stream 4K big upgrade over the fire stick if you have a 4K tv. Also the micro sd card slot is nice to have. It is also very compact. The one thing you will need to pick up is an HDMI cable it doesn't come with one.,positive
9851,5.0,The Fire TV was purchased for our living room and we primarily use it for watching Playstation Vue and Netflix. We already had a Fire Stick for my daughter's bedroom which we have found to be painfully slow. The Fire TV is a completely different experience - great performance and completely worth the extra money over the Fire Stick.,positive
9852,5.0,"I decided to cut the cable and bought Amazon fire tv. That along with a high definition antenna is all I need. So easy to set up and use. Tons of apps to choose from and I love Alexi. I simply tell her what show I want, she searches through all the apps and shows me where it is. How simple is that? Love it.",positive
9853,5.0,This is by far the best media box on the market. Easy to setup and extremely easy to use. If you are a Kodi user this by far the best box for it. A+++,positive

9858,5.0,"Great for family nights when you want entertain, and great for kids.",positive
9859,4.0,"We are really loving our Amazon Fire TV. We use it mostly for streaming Netflix because we haven't gotten into any of the Amazon episodes yet. We also use it for watching movies off our Amazon account. The picture quality is great and we haven't had any issues with streaming - no buffering and no freezing has occurred in the 9 months we've had the device. I like the parental control feature that requires you to put in a code before watching something. I'm not completely electronic savvy so I haven't really tried any other features on it yet. I have a Google Chromecast as well and it's my go-to for when we're traveling, but for our TVs at home, I'm very happy we got the FireTV and that it has a remote vs. using our phones or tablets. All in all, a great purchase.",positive
9860,5.0,This awesome little device is perfect for everyone. It has an expandable storage which allows you to add personal photos and videos to the Amazon Fire TV box. It's perfect for traveling especially when staying in hotels as you can watch subscribed programming anywhere. I recommend this product to everyone.,positive

9864,5.0,This device is very responsive and couples very well with an Amazon Membership.,positive
9865,5.0,So this thing sucks not many apps work on the amazon fire stick. It is better than the box but still blows chucks.,positive

9871,5.0,Super fast compared to the stick. This gets used all the time and saved me money.,positive
9872,5.0,"I researched and researched and researched streaming boxes from so many companies, including Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, and other off brands. By far, the Amazon TV was the best option for flexibility and reliability. I currently have three boxes now for each of my TVs and run PlayStation Vue. I have cut my cable bill by almost $70 per month. Plus, I now have the flexibility of other movie apps, Amazon content, and much more. The switch to streaming TV took less than 30 minutes. What a great investment with a very quick return.",positive
9873,4.0,I bought this to replace my satellite but have not done it yet. It is laggy at times and has connection issues. The remote looses connection often and doesn't connect back until batteries are removed. A bit hard to navigate with the remote. It works well if all you want is to get Kodi but it is kind off difficult for a newbie. With prime subscription it is great.,positive
9874,5.0,We got rid of cable so we bought this. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I do not miss cable at all!! My husband & I love it!!,positive
9875,5.0,"Good product for cutting cable cord and saving money. Faster and more features than Roku or Fire stick, very pleased with product. I originally received a defective remote, Best Buy customer service was excellent in trying to find a new one, even from competitor, they replaced with brand new unit same day I called, even though Best Buy warranty expired 2 weeks earlier.",positive
9876,5.0,This was my first time being introduced to the Fire Stick TV and it is awesome with all its features and ability to add multiple applications. 2 thumbs Up!!,positive
9877,5.0,Best buy had this product when no one else did. Ok,positive

9880,4.0,We purchased this item because our Smart TV has slowed down (Its a few years old) and we were tired of having to use our game consoles and/or phones to stream content. This solved our problem. The Fire TV is very fast and has tons of content.,positive
9881,4.0,Easy to find different apps on the Amazon fire box.,positive

9885,5.0,"This is probably the most used device in our home besides our phones. We use our fire tv daily, whether we are listening to music. Catching up on our favorite shows, or even watching a movie. I love the voice activated feature, it's nice to check the weather, movies playing at the local theatre, or look up you favorite artists.",positive
9886,5.0,I'm so happy I can stream movies from my amazon prime account,positive
9887,5.0,"Cut the cord, get rid of cable, and buy one of these. Great device easy to use. No reason to spend hundred plus dollars a month on cable just buy one of these and pay 15 to 20 bucks a month And subscribe to a couple video services",positive
9888,3.0,Price was right. Bought it mostly to be able to watch movies but the quality of the movies is not as good as I had hoped which is the main reason behind my average rating.,negative
9889,5.0,I am so happy I bought this I have firestick also and love to stream Netflix works amazing and much faster than firestick,positive
9890,5.0,"I use this with Kodi, HBO go, directv now, Hulu, prime, and Netflix. Everything runs smooth. I like having the USB port, because I have a controller, wireless keyboard and flash drive that I connect when needed. Can't ask for better.",positive
9891,3.0,"This is an excellent device and easy to use. 5 stars if you have Amazon Prime and want to use what's included with Prime. But if you don't have Prime, any Android TV Box would be better at half the cost.",negative
9892,5.0,great piece of technology. wish I would have found this sooner.,positive

9913,4.0,Fast delivery from Best Buy as always. The fire stick is awesome. High Quality video great selection. Good Value.,positive
9914,4.0,I love how this one lets you download apps. The picture quality is also a 4. I do find myself having to unplug it every 3 days to make it start over or it has trouble downloading. Especially with live tv apps. As for its competitors I'd say this is still the one to get. I find myself having a lot more options with this one. So my cons are minor. But still prevented me from a 5 star rating. I believe their next generation will be a 5 tho. Like I said. It's still the one with the most options available. Especially if you have prime. The best thing about Fire tv is it let's me download the direct tv app so I ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app. It's the same tv and I pay over a $100 less a month now. It's worth it just for that.,positive
9915,5.0,Buy this and load some software and you're set... Watch anything from sports to movies to tv shows...It's great!!!,positive

9922,5.0,Got them on every TV in the house. Fast internet is all you need,positive
9923,4.0,"So far I only see one flaw that bothers me, no volume control built into the remote, the device is very fast, easy to setup and use, though it does offer prime video stud right up front, but a couple pushes of a button and your on to your Netflix or hulu or what have you, works great with plex as well.",positive
9924,5.0,Got this for my 4K Sony. Works great. It's faster than the apps on the tv with more selection. Plus I really like the Alexa voice remote. You can just tell the remote what you want and it goes right to it. Searches all your apps!!,positive
9925,5.0,"Great, I can watch anything I want with hd quality",positive
9926,5.0,This is my second Amazon Fire TV. This is the newest version and the picture is quite a bit better thatn the first one. Viewing Playstation Vue it works flawlessly at 60 fps. So simple to hook up and use. Amazon had all my apps loaded as soon as I logged in. Love this product!,positive
9927,5.0,Upgrades from fire stick. Works good but I really don't see the difference between the stick. I guess a little faster and less buffering,positive

9934,5.0,Easy to connect and set up. Provides access to a lot of media. Alexa works great!,positive
9935,5.0,Wi-Fi works great lots of options for viewing and works quick. Small so fits behind TV and does not need to be indirect site for remote,positive

9949,5.0,"After using the Fire Stick for a few months and loving it I decided to give it to my sister and upgrade to the Fire TV for myself. Worth every penny! The Fire TV offers everything the Fire Stick offers but it's so much faster and has more than enough storage anyone would need. The microphone works great. The menu layout is improved and far better than the menu layout on the stick. I have the 4th generation Apple TV and I barely use it Bc the new remote is terrible. The sensitivity pad on the remote is all over the place. The home menu is boring. The only advantage the Apple TV has over the Fire TV is the seamless integration with other Apple devices such as iPhone and my MacBook. Other than that, the Fire TV is far better and I would recommend it over the Apple TV any day.",positive
9950,5.0,I like this better than the other devices its a bit pricey,positive

9955,5.0,"I saved $85 per month on my cable bill using the Amazon fire TV. And even though I signed up for Amazon prime, Netflix, and sling TV, I still saved $40 per month and have 10 times as much content and choices. I love it! ( I also recommend using Plex media server to stream all your content directly from your computers to your big screen TV. It's free! )",positive
9956,5.0,More poeerfyul than the fire stick same idea just bigger stronger and fastet,positive
9957,5.0,These work awesome. Products shipped on time. I would order again.,positive

9976,5.0,This is a great way to get rid of that monthly cable bill!,positive
9977,5.0,First I wanna say that the Amazon Fire Series is the best in media streaming devices out now. I purchased this do to the fact that i had a best buy rewards coupon since i racked up a lot of points from previous purchases. I was curious to see if this worked just like the fire stick. I am here to say it does and better. I wanted to try out my ethernet connection (RJ45) cable and see if it would lag or buffer. So far it has not. You can install kodi tv on this just like the fire stick. I just installed kodi version 17.1 and i must say it works faster and the movies are more clearer as well. I run it through my home audio receiver with an hdmi passthough which is more efficient for most of the smart tvs on the market today. The audio is way better i had to go to the settings on kodi and change from a 2.0 channel to 5.1 channel. It also has a sd card slot & usb drive as well don't know if i will ever need that.If you are an amazon prime member is also a good advantage as well because you can also stream any amazon prime video for free. Good job Amazon!!,positive
9978,5.0,Super easy to use. Love how it's voice activated so it is convenient,positive
9979,5.0,I do not regret making this purchase. So many movies and shows to choose from. Bang for your buck,positive
9980,5.0,This fire tv is awesome! Not only is it easy to set up and use but I'm saving a ton of money on cable :),positive
9981,5.0,One of the best streaming devices out and at a affordable price,positive
9982,4.0,Better processor than the fire stick and has Ethernet port which is always good.,positive
9983,5.0,Great does all that I want it too. Will be getting another soon.,positive
9984,5.0,Can't wait to make a clean break from cable company.,positive
9985,5.0,Perfect for us. We stream a lot and this does the job with minimal interruptions,positive
9986,5.0,This is a great product and use and connectivity are simple. Works well with my internet and TV....gives my smart TV an IQ boost..,positive

9990,5.0,Make sure that you get it soon. They sell out fast!,positive
9991,5.0,It's a great alternative to cable and satellite tv...,positive
9992,5.0,"If you want fast menus and stable streaming, avoid the WIFI only firestick, and get this FireTV. If you want reliable streaming that will not frustrate you, do the work of running an ethernet cable. This box with ethernet is head and shoulders better than a Firestick. Firestick streams well most of the time, but sometimes it struggles and you get errors with either DirecTV Now or PS Vue...forcing a device restart...very frustrating. This box plugged in with an ethernet cable streams perfectly on the same network with the same content 99.9% of the time. I eliminated conflicting frequencies, used 5 Ghz frequencies, have a great router, fast internet, I tried everything. The cure was this device hooked up by ethernet cable. The fact that you can put KODI on this box opens the whole world of movies up to you. You can also load Android apps from your phone to the device with Apps2Fire...I put Blue Iris on my FireTV. If have two of these in my home now, one in the Master Bedroom, and one on my 4K TV. There isn't a ton of 4k content yet, but you can go to Youtube and see some amazing video in 4k there. When I buy a new home at the end of the year I plan to run ethernet cable and have one of these at every television. I cut the cable company off 1 1/2 years ago and have never missed them. Other than internet, I pay $30 a month for PS Vue, and along with KODI I have everything I could possibly want and more. Goodbye Cable TV.",positive

10031,4.0,This is a great way to stop paying for cable or satellite TV or at least cut back. If you still want cable without paying for their equipment this item still does not support the twc app but does support fox go sports. That's why it doesn't get 5 stars.,positive

Also, downloaded a bunch of apps, and have been watching TED talks non-stop. Also bought an HD antenna for local channels, of which we get about 45. Deprogrammed the foreign language, shopping, preachers, and still left with about 35 which offer the 5 main broadcasters, and a LOT of 50s-70s repeats.",positive

You can get a lot of apps with this box and find it a bit faster than the first version. Pretty good buy in my opinion.",positive
10052,5.0,"Before buying the FireTV, I had the FireTV Sticks. In an effort to cancel my cable, I signed up for Playstation Vue. Vue worked on the FireTV Stick and got the job done but when a sale came for the FireTV, I thought why not. Boy, night and day difference in speed of menu transitions and buffering of shows. Everything is just snappier and faster. Going back to a FireTV Stick was so painful because of the lag in menu transitions. If you could afford it, go for the FireTV over the Stick. Also I own a Roku 2 and the FireTV is MUCH more useful because of the ability to sideload apps.",positive
10053,5.0,I really like this media streamer it works better than expected.,positive
10054,5.0,I use my Amazon fire TV as a replacement for my cable box. I have an Amazon prime membership and I watch their content plus I use the service sling to watch live TV.,positive

10057,3.0,"I got the FireTV stick more than a year ago. It works fine although streaming video from my NAS sometimesnot very smooth. As I found the NBC Sports app allowed me to watch Olympics on the stick and this FireTV was on sale, I upgraded to this box. The result is a mix. It does stream video better than the stick but the same app did not work on the FireTV as with the stick It keeps giving the authorization error in playing some video clips. Withe same account, I can play the same video clips on FireTv stick or on Android boxes and tablets. I decided to keep it simply because of the great price I paid.",negative

10060,5.0,"This is my second Fire TV box, and it's a great upgrade from the first gen model I had. The buffer time is lightning quick, faster than my Roku. The 4K works well, and the Amazon ecosystem is actually more complete than what the Apple TV offers. Very happy with this purchase.",positive
10061,5.0,"Got more than I expected. Got it as a device which replaced my cable box. Subscribed to PS Vue service, works very well. Cut my cable bill from 80 odd to 29. This little device is very snappy. Has much more apps than the Nexus player. With Netflix, Amazon prime movies , Kodi and NBC Sports : that pretty much covers 99% of the content which I would watch.",positive
10062,3.0,"If you're already fully committed to the 'Amazon' ecosystem - as in: you have a Prime account, then this is a decent buy. I found it hard to get used to having advertisements in your face, and all the Amazon branding you see everywhere. Aside from those annoyances, the device itself is quite sleek and works fine for Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video streaming. Playing files directly from a USB drive or MicsoSD card was a bit clunky but still do-able. An active internet connection is required to use most features of the device.",negative
10063,5.0,easy to use and navigate. controller is not complicated.,positive
10064,2.0,"I had the original fire stick and I don't truly see that great of a difference between the new and older version. I was hoping that whe. The new version came out I could really understand and justify why I was paying more for a new one, when my old one worked just fine. Unfortunately, I can't. For me, it's not worth the money and I returned the item and stuck with my other one.",negative
10065,5.0,This toy is easy to setup and the 4k feature compliments my 4k tv. The dedicated amazon fire tv works better than amazon in my smart tv.,positive

10078,5.0,"amazing deal, quick and fast menus, and 4k! cant be beat",positive
10079,3.0,I didn't see that much of an improvement from the fire stick so I don't think it worth the extra cash. Decided to go with fire stick to save a bit.,negative
10080,5.0,"Oh my, I can't say enough for things about this device. I've been a loyal firestick user for one a year now, I've switched to the box back in may and it was well worth the extra 50 bucks. 80 times faster, live TV works incredibly.",positive
10081,3.0,"The Fire TV is a good device with a powerful processor and the best Playstation Vue interface. However, it can be frustrating to access the channels you've added as you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all - one by one. The Roku allows you to arrange your channels in whatever order you choose. The Roku has the most channel options - including Vudu (a channel not available on the Fire TV). Still, if you intend to use the Playstation Vue service you'll be much happier with the Fire TV.",negative

10101,5.0,We went from a Roku 1 to this and are very pleased. Not fair to compare the two as the Roku 1 is old tech. You would have to compare it to the Roku 4. This streams very smoothly. Look and feel are great. So is voice search for Amazon Prime content.,positive
10102,5.0,Fire TV is the best way to cut the cord with the cable company. We have Fire sticks already but the TV is much better.,positive

10121,5.0,"The Amazon Fire TV product is great, highly recommend it to anyone. Best Buy's service on the sale was not. I ordered the item online for an in store pick up the next day. Went to pick it up and they said it was scheduled for delivery to a home address in 10-15 days. Although they had plenty in stock, Their only option was to cancel the order and redo the sale. While this may not seem like a big deal it was not how I wanted the purchase processed, since I was getting bonus miles with a specific credit card.",positive
10122,5.0,"The product is easy to understand and use. If you have already viewed a series from Plex, Hulu, or another provider, the remote will take you to where you left off. If you want to view something from Amazon Prime you press the button and speak the name and it finds it for you.",positive
10123,5.0,"Amazon Fire TV has been a great device and is a big improvement over the Amazon Firestick. With Fire TV, there is no lag in apps and runs smoothly and without delay. The biggest reason we purchased this was to begin using PlaystationVUE and it has worked flawlessly.",positive

10138,5.0,I have cut my cable. I would have done this before but didn't know how to get college sports. Fire with Amazon and SlingTV has bridged the gap. I receive local channels with an antennae and the fire does the rest. Saving about $75 per month.,positive

All my Amazon contents are on here.I'm trying to cut my cable tv provider out and I think I found a good solution. When my FIOS contract end, I'm moving over to the Fire TV and I'll just get a HD antenna for the house. This unit is very fast and very capable. Based on the Android environment, you can do almost anything on here (entertainment wise.)",positive
10141,5.0,"It is faster than amazon fire tv 1st. it was so easy to connect and work! Plus I have the 4k TV and it's a 4k system. You can watch some tvs, movies and some 4k contents for free if you are a amazon prime member, $99 plus tax for a year.",positive
10142,4.0,I like the fire tv because it's easy to use and I can get all my services in one box. I also like the voice control feature and the included games. The thing I dont like is that sometimes the cache gets full and the stream starts to cuts even with my 100M conection. A faster dual or quad core procesor with more memory would be great.,positive

10163,5.0,"Works great, the talking assistant is a great novelty although I personally don't use it that much. HD clarity is fantastic on a 4K TV. Highly recommended if not using on a smart tv, which can already connect to Amazon by itself. Although the HD is actually better through the external device",positive
10164,5.0,"First we purchased the Firestick that ran off of wifi only...ours was too far away from the router and was buffering all the time. Close-by it worked great, but we upgraded to connect directly and we've had no problems. Wonderful product and serves our needs...the voice command for questions is a nice feature as well.",positive
10165,5.0,awesome product. Very glad I made the small investment to get this. I don't even have to use my cable anymore because of this small device.,positive

10167,5.0,"I had originally bought the Fire Stick to do live streaming and it worked great, but after awhile I decided to upgrade to a faster media box. After a lot of research reading a ton of reviews I decided to get the Fire TV and I'm glad I did. The Fiire TV is works great with my Amazon Prime account, it's much faster especially connected via Ethernet, the memory is expandable, better picture, better wifi, and with the 2gb ram I'm seeing virtually no buffering with playing 1080p content! The remote is a lot better than the original and the voice commands are an added plus. I would definitely with no hesitation recommend getting this if you are Prime Member and want quality streaming. Cheers!",positive
10168,5.0,Amazon does it again with a great product. Pushes 4K seemlessly and am very satisfied with the product,positive
10169,5.0,"Seems less finnicky than the Chromecast (sorry, the *GoogleCast*) in a lot of ways... though I learned how picky it is about resolution when I tried hooking it up to a stand-alone monitor. It didn't care for that so much.",positive
10170,5.0,"Upgrade from Fire Stick and it's the best decision I made. It's fast, easy to setup, and came with loaded apps. NO MORE CABLE FEE.",positive
10171,3.0,Netflix app runs great no buffering and good HD quality. Amazon app and movies have their issues. But overall I like my fire tv. If only Amazon ran like Netflix then would be 5 stars.,negative
10172,5.0,I cut my cable and move to Playstation Vue. Amazon fire tv boxes are fast and picture quality is amazing. I purchase 4 boxes for the whole house.,positive
10173,5.0,"This is actually worth the money to purchase if you're wanting to watch Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. Everything that you can download on your android devices will be on here and you can even download games to play for kids and adults alike. Easy to set up and use. Just need to set up your Amazon account, and if you don't have one you can make one to use it. Bought one for my mother in law. Best $100 spent. I do not regret this purchase at all.",positive
10174,5.0,We officially cut the cord and decided to use this as well as an antenna for local TV...The screen resolution is great. Navigation speed is quick without delay. We use Playstation Vue and it works seamlessly with the Fire TV...,positive

10176,5.0,Being an Amazon Prime member this little box made a great addition.,positive
10177,5.0,"We had the Amazon FireTV stick but it was VERY slow and tended to freeze up now and then in the middle of high-definition movies. So, I asked the Best Buy sales person if I would see an improvement with the FireTV box, and he said yes. Sure enough, he was correct. It is SO much better. We are enjoying this product much better than the stick version. It's worth spending the extra money.",positive

10181,5.0,"I use this and my Apple TV, the amazon fire box is great you can watch your favorite shows through them and Hulu and Netflix, what makes the fire stand out is that you can add apps you can't find in their App Store, kodi makes cutting the cord so easy!",positive
10182,5.0,A great alternative to cable/satellite. Not as expensive as Apple TV but just as much content. Got it on sale at a great price.,positive
10183,5.0,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV to cut my cable and use it for Play Station Vue. It has worked great. It is super fast compared to the fire stick. I tried the Roku as well but for this application the Fire tv was the clear winner. I liked it so much I bought 3. One for all my Tvs. The Roku didn't have a guide menu and that was a big issue. It also works great with Netflixs. Picture quality is great, probably better than what I was getting with cable. Overall this is going to save me a lot of money and I am not missing any quality or channels.",positive
10184,5.0,"It works great. I had a an Amazon Fire Stick previously. The Amazon Fire TV responds quicker and I have not had any buffering issues, thanks to a faster network interface card.",positive
10185,5.0,"Use this to stream Netflix, hulu, sling TV, and now Vue tv. Ended up canceling sling TV bc Vue tv is better and more channels for less.",positive
10186,5.0,"If you want to start using Kodi and don't want to spend $200+ on a Nvidia Shield and don't want the laggy performance of a Fire Stick, spend your money on the Fire TV BOX. Runs amazing!!!",positive
10187,5.0,"havent been able to use to its full potential, but cant wait",positive
10188,5.0,I uses these for Kodi and they never let me down. Hate seeing people pay more for items that don't need it. If you interested in difference between fire tv and fire stick the TV is boat loads faster than the stick. I started with 2 sticks and now have 2 TV's,positive
10189,4.0,"Good box, but menu slow when booting up and control loses sync at times.",positive
10190,5.0,"A good friend of mine got into transforming Fire Sticks and Fire TV two Kodi boxes. He brought over his Fire TV and led us use it and afterwards my wife was convinced that we needed to have one. With Fire TV it makes Kodi stream smoothly and the menus are quick.

10195,5.0,"I travel a lot and stay at different hotels...it works perfect for this.

10199,5.0,we love our amazon firetv box it does so much for such a nice price,positive
10200,4.0,I have three amazon products this as well as a kindle and fire stick. This fire TV has the advantage because of the ethernet port. Offers Fox Go for the Yankees but still no TWC compatibility which is why it gets 4 stars out of 5.,positive
10201,4.0,Easy to setup and use and now with voice search. I recommend it with even 4K content. Best Buy had it on sale as well.,positive

I have read that the newer remote with the rubber buttons was not as good as the plastic buttons, but I have had no problems with it so far. The TV is faster than the stick and the voice search function is very convenient. Overall I am satisfied with the upgrade and even more so at the sale price.",positive

10219,3.0,"I do like the Amazon TV idea. I do miss my DVR. I also miss all of the LIVE TV abilities though. Until Amazon TV gets LIVE TV abilities, this only gets 3 stars. Works well. Easy connect. But there are alot of reasons to miss Cable tv!! The channel selection needs to improve!",negative
10220,5.0,"Wish I would of purchased sooner , one of best item",positive
10221,5.0,"We already had a 1st generation in the media room and a FireTV stick in the bedroom. We have the stick to my sister-in-law (which she loves) and moved the old FireTV to the bedroom and the new model to the media room. We use it for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Plex. All of which seem to run a little faster and handle .mkv and .mp4 videos much better.",positive
10222,4.0,"I'm pretty happy with this, just takes a little bit of time to figure out were everything is at.",positive
10223,4.0,"Faster than the stick. Overall it is great. 4 stars due to occasional buffering or errors. My internet speed is fast enough, so it isn't clear if internet or box is issue. I use with PlayStation vue and I am happy with it and cancelling cable!",positive
10224,4.0,I'm happy with the purchase. Had to buy additional memory but satisfied.,positive
10225,4.0,"Recently purchased this amazon fire box. I am still learning how to work everything. I am enjoying it so far. You do have to have a Netflix account and alot of the other applications to use alot of things. However, their is a work around for everything lol. I will possibly invest in more of these down the line and maybe get my family to finally cut the cord also.",positive
10226,4.0,"We bought this Amazon Fire TV to use for our Sony PlayStation Vue package as part of our cord-cutting plan. We are also Amazon Prime members so it made sense for that application also. The picture is great on our Samsung 65"" 4K tv. The only drawback so far (why I only gave it 4 stars) is that our Logitech Harmony 650 remote will not operate it, thereby forcing us to keep track of the remote.",positive
10227,5.0,"Great product, I have Apple TV 3, and this is just as good or better.",positive
10228,5.0,I wish i had known about this product sooner works great.,positive

10244,5.0,Way better than the firesticks. I would definitely recommend this item,positive
10245,4.0,"The product works very well, but the user interface is too busy and not really tunable. It is also difficult to search for new apps that aren't already listed. Voice control works okay, but Alexa remains a far cry from Siri.",positive
10246,5.0,Setup was very simple. I can actually hide it behind TV and still use remote. I was surprised how fast it boots up. Makes my TV a smart TV that allows many more apps than the ones that come built in generally.,positive
10247,5.0,I have had other devices like this. This one by far is the best. No glitches or buffering.,positive
10248,5.0,This was a simple set up. Worked immediatel . We added the net gear extender due to the size of our house and llocation of our tv.,positive
10249,4.0,was skeptical at first because I thought it would be the same as the fire stick.Boy was I wrong.4k is awesome on my 4k tetevision.,positive

10254,3.0,"We've tried several of these little streamer boxes - Fire TV, Roku3, Apple TV (not the newest one). I think the Roku is my favorite. This one is competent, if you have Amazon Prime you'll miss it on the Apple TV. But the voice command mode - the one distinguishing feature of the Fire - is not useful. It only searches Amazon content and while Amazon has a lot of stuff we watch more on Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Hulu, etc. So, not so useful. I would get the Roku. The remote with headphones is a great feature.",negative
10255,4.0,Amazon - Fire Tv is ok. i was thinking it was going to be faster then the Amazon stick.,positive
10256,4.0,"These Fire TV boxes are a bit bigger then the Fire stick but carry much more processing power and memory.

10272,5.0,I don't really see a difference between the box and the stick. They both buffer. I do like that I expand the memory on the box.,positive
10273,5.0,Best purchase I made this year. I got the Amazon TV box for the TV in the kitchen. I took the cable box back to the cable company. No more boxes I am savings money.

10283,5.0,I've had the Amazon Fire TV for a few weeks now an absolutely love it. My wife and I have cut the cords with cable tv and now stream everything through Fire TV. The quad core processor can keep up with the most demanding HD streams and 3D movies without buffering. If needed Fire TV can be hardwired to you router for additional speed. The apps are endless and you can run all of the popular options out there including Hulu and Sling. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking to escape cable.,positive
10284,5.0,"I bought this item and have not been able to put the remote down. A great product that I would recommend for anyone, works well with my 4K TV",positive

10290,5.0,"I owned a Fire Stick previously, but when I bought a 4K TV, I wanted a media streamer that could playback 4K content. I tried the Roku but ultimately returned it for the Fire TV because it allows CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) over HDMI, which the Roku did not. For those who don't know, CEC (found in most new TV sets) allows your remote that comes with the TV to control other devices connected through an HDMI cable. Now I only need one remote for everything and didn't have to go out and purchase an expensive universal remote. The Fire TV was exactly what I needed for my 4K setup and now I use my Fire Stick for travel. Great product and great service from Best Buy.",positive
10291,3.0,"This product is well made, durable and reliable. I have had good experiences with this manufacturer. I recommend this manufacturer and this particular product. This product does exactly what I need it to do. Super easy to use. I have used other manufacturers in the past but have not always been satisfied. I am happy with this product.",negative
10292,5.0,Decided to go with this along with playstation vue and a couple other subscriptions I already had to cut the cord from cable. This little box is excellent for all sorts of streaming. Shows come in very clear. The response time is great. Only down side is bluetooth and not IR but a nice $20 adapter and boom now my universal remote works with this. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking to cut ties with their cable company.,positive
10293,5.0,Bought this on a flash sale 64.99!! This is great especially when running the playstation vue app streaming!,positive
10294,5.0,"Fire TV is a game changer, definitely worth it to spend the extra clams on this over the fire stick. Awesome product,",positive

10297,5.0,I have watched about 15 to 20 movies and haven't experience any buffering or freeze,positive

10299,5.0,I like this much better than the fire stick. Great for Alexa!,positive
10300,5.0,"Makes Dumb TV Smart, very small package. Slides under flat screen TV, remote works everywhere, no lost signal. Fire works better wireless...weird...Voice control is a nice feature, but the remote gets me there faster.",positive
10301,5.0,"I have the Amazon stick but this is much faster and better. I am very happy I purchase the Amazon TV box. I bought this TV box for my bedroom which I spend 90% of my time. It is much faster than my regular Netflix site. I love the idea I can also log on to my Netflix on the TV box, too. I am going to get another one for my family room. Good thing it was on the Labor Day sale (Smile)",positive
10302,5.0,"I think it is a great product, although I could not say whether Fire TV is better than Apple TV. Fire TV is better with the Amazon movies and shows, while Apple TV is directly through the iTune store for movies and shows.",positive
10303,5.0,"This is the best streaming box for the money, it does favor amazon content.",positive
10304,5.0,"I have owned a few more similar products including the fire stick. The stick works on but the TV work great! Zero lag, runs like a top, streams perfectly! Its the perfect start for getting rid of your cable bill.",positive
10305,4.0,I've use the Amazon fire tv and the Roku. The Amazon fire box In my opinion is easier to use and I prefer the Amazon remote over the Roku. The only problem I've had with Amazon fire would be the life of the batteries in the remote.,positive
10306,5.0,"It works very well out of the box. Most of the apps you want will be there. The remote works flawlessly and is blue tooth so you don't have to point it at the box. Amazon locks down android, so you are missing some apps, but all of your streaming apps will be here. Expanded memory is nice as well. Great beginner device.",positive
10307,4.0,Setup is extremely easy. Access to numerous movies and apps. Streaming works great. Perfect option for people who want to stop paying for cable. Ensure the software is updated after first setting up your Amazon account. Few Cons: Only able to use the voice search option on the main screen.Must reboot occasionally if WiFi connection fails.,positive
10308,2.0,"This device is much slower than other similar devices on the market. The internet connection is not stable, even when direct in via Ethernet.",negative
10309,5.0,"Runs much better than the fire stick, especially for some apps such as Playstation Vue. The fire stick is more convenient and takes less room but is not as powerful. If you are buying the product for Playstation Due then you will be returning the Fire Stick to buy this one.",positive
10310,5.0,"I liked the first one so much, I went out and bought another one! Love everything about this product. Please ensure you have great internet in order to properly run the services.",positive
10311,4.0,"PROS:1) What an ultra HD clarity. It is just awesome..2) Very easy interaction to navigate.3) Earlier I have used ROKU but after AMAZON FIRE TV stands miles ahead of ROKU in many positive ways.CONS:1) You can't use voice remote in many apps. Very few options to use voice search.2) Wifi signal receiver is very poor. Initially I used this on WI-FI and at that time it will keep on buffering and clarity was very poor. I contacted with AMAZON and raised as defect and got new one. Again same issue happened then I used it over ETHERNET port and then I realized the problem is with the WI-FI receiving capacity of this device. I placed my laptop near to my AMAZON device and took speed test it showed 25MBPS, even then clarity was very poor over WI-FI.Hence I would recommend to use this over ETHERNET connection.",positive
10312,5.0,"Great device. Very fast and responsive. Capable of streaming in 4k and while there is limited content, it comes thru beautifully. Alexa and voice search is fantastic.",positive
10313,4.0,"Still learning how to use all the features. Searching is a breeze. Can search by many options. Have used it by actor, movie title, or show title. It will bring back what is available and sometimes advises of other sources (ie. Netflix). The voice search feature is a homerun! No more typing in the name without a keyboard!",positive
10314,5.0,"Great hardware. I owned the Fire Stick before getting this. It's WELL worth the extra money. Loads WAY faster and much less buffering. I love Amazon Prime. Wish there was better/newer/more frequent movies but for being included with all the other Prime services, it's a deal. And the Fire TV is the perfect way to access it.",positive

10319,5.0,"Got this while on sale & used Best Buy points ! Got it for super cheap . Being a Prime member makes this worth while. So far the Fire TV has performed flawlessly. There are many apps to choose from, some not available on my Apple TV . This box is 4K ready with some Prime eligible titles to stream . The interface is not quite as nice as Apple TV but works ok . I would say it is worth what I paid and then some !",positive

10323,5.0,Bought this to use in my basement after I decided to cut the cord. This item works awesome and is exactly what I needed. The main reason I purchased it was to stream PS Vue but there are many other devices that do that now. Not at all disappointed with this item.,positive

10332,4.0,"Great addition to my older ""dumb"" Samsung TV. I'm an Amazon Prime member so it made sense to purchase this to watch Prime Videos. Another great feature is the ability to load and use Playstation Vue app to stream cable television which has allowed me to discontinue my overpriced satellite TV service. My only con, was that the provided voice remote sometimes would lose connectivity and the buttons were rendered useless. Resetting the unit helps, but very annoying. Luckily, there's a Fire TV app for mobile devices for remote control. Overall, I do recommend this product.",positive
10333,5.0,"Fast set up, 4k compatible and for more storage USB and SD card port.",positive

10353,5.0,"I am very satisfied with the Amazon TV. While I have used an Amazon Firestick, I bought this unit primarily because of the ethernet connection in order to get a faster streaming speed while watching TV shows and movies. Another nice feature is the USB connection. It makes it very easy to view and listen to music audios, videos and photos on a thumb drive.I recommend it to anyone who has internet hardwire options available.",positive
10354,5.0,Installation was quick and I was watching in no time. Love the voice search and Alexa integration. Amazon integration is Perfect. Unfortunately the Voice Search only searches Amazon video and not Netflix like the Roku. For 4k this device supports 30fps and the Roku supports 60 fps. I don't know if that is a big deal yet or not until I get my 4K TV. I bought this because of the price point and I already had two Roku sticks. I also found that Amazon does NOT support certain movies on certain devices. i.e. I could not stream Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket on the Roku stick but it was available on the PS3. You have to look at Supported Devices in each movie to determine. When I started commenting on it in the Amazon forums they all of a sudden showed up :-)!,positive

10376,5.0,"I purchased this item, along with an HD antenna to finally cut the cable. Prices were getting out of control with the cable monopoly. This product really delivers. All the entertainment you could possibly want at your fingertips. I use it to stream PlayStation Vue. After experimenting with all devices. I feel this is by far the best.

10434,4.0,"Like many others, I decided to cut cable and move to more online based video services. The Amazon Fire TV has easily become a centerpoint of our living room. We stream all of our favorite apps off this device (Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, NBC Live Extra, Playstation Vue, WATCH ESPN, and many more!).Pros: The Amazon Fire TV is portable and much more powerful than its little brother, the Fire TV Stick. The Fire TV has double the cores, double the RAM and has a slot for memory expansion when compared to the Fire Stick. Of course that all comes at a price, but its worth it. The Fire TV does not buffer nearly as often as my Fire Stick or Chromecast. This device is a 4K streaming device, but you'll need to find 4K content to take advantage of it.Cons: The experience from the get-go is VERY Amazon centric, with the platform optimized for searching and viewing Amazon video titles. I havent found the Voice Control to be of much use, as it is only really helpful for searching Amazon video.",positive

10468,5.0,Love the fire stick. And the price wad the best price compared to other stores,positive
10469,5.0,"What's great about the Fire TV is it's great interface, and frankly it's affordability. If you want 4K streaming, a fast fluid interface, then this is what you want! The nVidia Shield is great, and yeah it's powerful... and plays games, but for the price, and if you just want to stream it's not worth it. The selection of Android games is so limited, don't waste your money! I've also been turned off by the Roku interface, it seems too kiddish, and just not as intuitive. I am using these Fire TV devices through out the house to stream Live TV, and my movie collection through an app called Emby. It's a fantastic experience for the whole family and saves me a bundle on rental fees from the cable company, and electricity due to it's low power consumption. If you want just want to stream, and play your home movie collection this is what you want!",positive

10488,5.0,this is the fastest streaming device amazon offers you will not be diapointed,positive
10489,5.0,"It is very fast and reliable, it is everything it says it is...",positive
10490,4.0,"It is so nice to have all these streaming services in one box, and the voice command feature works great! Smooth UI with no lag, especially compared to it's little brother, the Fire Stick. My only complaint is that there is no 4K Resolution support.",positive
10491,5.0,"I was quite surprised by the ease with of setting this up. The voice control with Alexa works great, far exceeded my expectations. Great picture quality and a good selection of shows and movies.",positive
10492,5.0,A little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it it's very satisfying,positive
10493,5.0,"I have Amazon Prime and this makes it so easy to watch movies or tv shows. HULU, Netflix and many other ways to watch what you want when you want to watch it. I am now ready to cut the cable.",positive
10494,5.0,The fire tv is worth every penny. I have not had any issues with my device,positive
10495,4.0,I own an Apple TV also and content is just as good. Very easy to navigate. I also use my phone's app to navigate thru the menu.,positive
10496,5.0,I love the Amazin FireTV stick! I have one in every room of the house and don't have to worry about a cable bill ever again.,positive
10497,3.0,"Good performance for most apps. However, I primarily purchased it to watch PS Vue, and although the PS Vue app is better than on Roku, it suffers from more lag and glitches than watching PS Vue via PS4 or PS3.",negative
10498,5.0,"I love my amazon fire tv, there are a lot of great features. I highly recommend it.",positive
10499,3.0,Ok I need to learn how to use it I would recommend,negative
10500,5.0,This has a great menu and its a lot easier to find then the apps on the tv. Its much quicker then the fire stick,positive
10501,5.0,"I am an Amazon Prime member and decided to take advantage of Prime Video and Prime Music. I recently ""cut the cord"" on cable and subscribed to SlingTV. Amazon Fire TV works great with SlingTV and many other apps listed in the description. The menu design is simple and easy to use. It is a great purchase and you can get even more out of your Amazon Prime membership with the Amazon Fire TV",positive
10502,5.0,"This works much better than the fire stick. There is no buffering at all with movies and tv. Ended up buy 2 more,.",positive
10503,5.0,This is a great alternative to cable/box. Saves $.,positive
10504,5.0,"I am extremely happy with the box, well over the stick. Twice as fast, twice as much RAM and up to almost 30 times as much memory",positive
10505,4.0,It's a great product that allowed me to cancel cable television.,positive
10506,4.0,"I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets. Awesome if you want to listen you a show in bed without disturbing others.",positive
10507,5.0,Good product good service...attended real good.Find product ok.,positive
10508,5.0,Great way to save on cable. Wifi enabled so really simple to install.,positive
10509,5.0,Had a fire stick and loved it. Eventually got this because I wanted the 4K capabilities. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. I use it for sling tv a lot as well.,positive
10510,5.0,I'm really enjoying my amazon fire tv. I should have bought it a long time ago. Alexa is a very cool feature.,positive
10511,5.0,"We got the new Amazon fire TV as we got a new 4K tv. Right now there is still not as much 4K content as I would like, however it does 4K very well. Netflix and Amazon prime have a few 4K tv shows and movies that are available if you have a 4K tv, but the New Fire TV also has upgraded internals and faster wireless making everything much snappier. I would recommend a wired connection if you can, streaming will look much better and pause much less often.",positive
10512,5.0,My kid enjoys watching his cartoons on the fire tv,positive
10513,5.0,"Nice interface, easy to use. Smooth, no buffering.",positive
10514,4.0,"But, fast forwarding through content can reset the cursor and put you at the beginning of the content. And, occasionally can get you out of the application. Perhaps additional memory in a future version of this product may fix this. However, watching subscription free content is always a treat.Good solid product. I also own Roku and its interface slightly easier for elderly and those with not much patience.",positive
10515,5.0,This is an excellent piece. We use is it mainly for Netflix but there are so many other features yet to explore.,positive

10527,4.0,Great for streaming TV/ movies. I hardly ever have interruptions.,positive

10551,4.0,It is very simple to set up on your tv we were going to run a cable to the other tv in the bedroom but it was less money to purchase the fire stick,positive
10552,4.0,The Best Android Based Set-Top Box For it's Price.Amazon outdid themselves here with their Fire TV line. They got it right and they do not appear to be abandoning this anytime soon so hop on now while it's still hot.,positive

10562,5.0,"We don't have the best wifi in our house which caused the firestick to continually buffer. Since getting the fire tv we almost never have buffering, it's quicker and much more reliable.",positive
10563,4.0,I have about every single streaming player on the market. This one is not better or worse than the others. I got it only for using 3rd party apps. For that it works flawlessly! If you need a streaming device this one will fit the bill.,positive
10564,4.0,"amazon-fire tv, easy install,very easy to start using.",positive
10565,5.0,I purchased this to watch PlayStation Vue which it does very well. It is relatively small and does to make any noise that I can detect.,positive
10566,5.0,bought this unit as a door price at work . my fellow employees went bananas when they seen this as a prize option. last x- mas I gave away the fire stick and that was a big hit,positive
10567,5.0,Very easy to use and has a bunch of great features. The voice remote and app make it even better.,positive
10568,5.0,"Ever since I had my fire TV jail broken and programmed, I can finally cancel my cable subscription. Everything I once paid for on cable, my fire TV (KODI app) does for FREE!!!!!",positive
10569,5.0,"Easy to use, great product. Cost is great, many features.",positive
10570,5.0,I have several sticks and they eventually get glitchy and need to be rebooted. The box never does this. It also runs faster and responds better at all times. Get the box not the stick.,positive
10571,3.0,"navigation needs more work, no pointer feature sucks, definitely NOT a point-and-click systemes explore for web browsing is antiquated and needs replacedvoice alexa feature does NOT work inside apps to control the app, so careful what you say or needless purchases are madeno disable option for voice featurestill one of the cheapest ways to run kodi program direct to telly in HDMI tho.one can still load app for plex server for NAS playback via streaming, though it is extremely difficult to navigate the plex download page in es explore.its faster than old version, has Bluetooth 4.1 instead of 3.1, has a quad-core instead of dual-core processor, and doesn't seem to get hot after hours of play like old version did.But, If Amazon ever blocked third party apps like kodi and plex I would never buy an amazon product again tho.Not an amazon prime member and never will be, why pay for programming that I can get for free.",negative

10576,5.0,Very fast response to the different apps and looks great with my 4K tv,positive
10577,4.0,I purchased strictly for PS VUE and can confirm it works great including 60FPS and lag-free (almost as good as PS4) guide navigation. It is drastically improved in speed over the 2nd gen fire stick ($40) which had too much navigation lag and capped at 30FPS. The Fire TV is much faster and worth the extra money as it also includes 4K and a gigabit ethernet port. It does lack VUDU and Google Play so not all apps are available and will not likely be available due to Amazon Prime proprietary service. Overall it functions great and is very FAST!,positive
10578,5.0,This amazon fire tv box is one of the best media devices available.,positive
10579,4.0,Easy to use and A smoother interface than others like it,positive

10606,5.0,one of the best media player options for streaming TV,positive
10607,4.0,Like the hardware. Both box and the remote control is very aethetic and nice to use. processor is fastest by the time I bouth it and still fast enough for my system. Liked that I could install android apps.I wish they implemented NTFS for the microSD card file system. It is limited to FAT32 that limits a file size less thn 4GB. No power off switch is another bummer. But overall I chose this over Roku 3 (or even 4).,positive
10608,5.0,I got tired of high cable bills and joined the cord cutting stampede. This works great and I save $100 a month. I also got a deal for half off the antenna for local channels when I bought it. Can't go wrong.,positive
10609,5.0,I use this to have many TVs running at the same time without having to pay for cable.,positive
10610,5.0,I love the Fire TV because I can stream all NFL games with the Kodi app and all of my Prime shows.,positive
10611,5.0,This does everything i need and want it to do. All extras in one place.,positive
10612,5.0,OTT= Over the Top digital television is the wave of the future for the TV industry. Amazon Fire TV is leading this revolution.,positive
10613,4.0,Very universal in use and was of applications. Real quick in response,positive

10625,5.0,"I had used Roku, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV and Smart TV's digital feed. This device does the heavy lifting effortlessly, at $100.00 price point and allows the versitility of android tv customization.The Apple and Android Smart Phone Remote app trumps all the others.Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner.",positive
10626,4.0,Tried the Roku 3 on a set and recently added this to another. Really like the ease of use and voice search feature. Would prefer less an amazon centered home page - otherwise a 5 star product.,positive

10633,4.0,Very pleased experience installation and setup....,positive
10634,5.0,After using one at a relative's house I finally decided to purchase one of these. I've struggled with the slowness of smart tv built in apps or even the apps on my bluray player and this was finally the solution to that. It's fast and has tons of content.,positive
10635,4.0,I do like the Amazon fire TV. There are a few things I do not like. Mainly the layout of the menus amd getting around. To many duplicates displayed and to many pay for shows mixed in. Even with prime there are things you have to pay for. There is an option to see only prime but you have to set it each time and that blows. They really need to work on thier menus.,positive
10636,5.0,I bought this not really knowing any Amazon products and I gotta say.... it has become one of my top 5 gadgets! It's aweomse!!!!!!!! I've made my sisters get one too!!!!!,positive
10637,5.0,"I had this for over 3 months and I'm liking this more and more. It has a lot of potential. 1st of, hardware wise. It's the best of the bunch. It can support up to a 4k display, has an Ethernet port and a microsd slot. It's small and compact so I can tuck it way from sight. This is fast. Virtually little to no lag. Everything is smooth and responsive. If I did have to complain, it's the time to start up the unit from a cold start. 2nd, It's based of of Android so the potential to root and install a media player is a possibility. 3rd, rarely has any buffering issue. Why did I bring this up. It all depends on your provider. When I has FIOS and hardwire the Fire player to the router, it keeps buffering. I don't know why. I have 50 up/down. When I changed providers, TWC/Spectrum, I have Zero buffering issues. To me, I think FIOS is throttling HD contents.To sum it up, this is way better than the stick because of the hard-wiring capabilities. MircoSD slot for expandable and this is freaking fast then the stick. Well worth the extra $30-$40.",positive
10638,5.0,Great improvement from the original version and much better than apple tv,positive

10642,5.0,This is a great product. Great tv and awesome for family content.,positive
10643,4.0,Was looking for something that would work with most apps when cutting the cord and chose this. Works as stated and way faster than even the new smart TV's processors. All but got rid of the annoying buffering times.,positive

10675,5.0,"We had a streaming movie box that had Kodi pre-loaded. Even though the box was capable of speeds up to 100 mbps, it seemed to always buffer or just stop. We bought the Amazon fire because it supports up to 200 mbps and supports 4k as well. I rarely have any issues now. Also the number of apps this will run is great.",positive

10684,4.0,The Fire TV itself is great for streaming various media over our wireless network to our TV in our sun room. At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly. The applications are fast and responsive and the menus are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house. The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that has a LCD screen on it and it doesn't go through batteries as fast the Fire TV remote. We now remove the batteries whenever the remote is not in operation. An annoyance but not a deal breaker.,positive
10685,5.0,"This is a nice item to get especially when your husband is a movie buff. It will allow you to go to extended channels in order to watch whatever taste you may have for watching TV..

That's an issue on my side not the device. Easy to tranfer apps from android phone using app called apps2fire available at the play store. Most apps transferred work but not all of them. 3rd party game pads work also via Bluetooth. A+++",positive
10704,5.0,I have plenty of Firesticks. This is an upgrade. Lets me stream faster because it has a faster processor. Family loves it. It knocks down the cable bills.,positive

10720,5.0,"I've had the Fire Stick version of the Fire TV for quite a while, but finally went for the more powerful unit. This little guy is great, does a fine job of bringing in the Amazon offerings as well as playing some casual games (we tried some trivia and other simple games). The voice control is excellent. Overall I am very pleased with this unit. If I had to come up with something they could improve, it would be the feel of the remote. It has a bit of a fragile/flimsy feel to it.",positive

10726,4.0,Very fast easy to use easy to find better than the stick,positive
10727,5.0,"Snappy and reliable performance. This is exactly what I expected its little brother to be. Works great with our system. We generally use our Echo as the speaker and they work well together. My only real complaint is the lack of certain apps, Vudu in particular, but I can't blame that on the device or its manufacturer - that falls to the app developers.",positive
10728,5.0,"The voice remote is awesome. Now I have ""Alexa"" on my TV as well. Good quality streaming content and it has everything you need: Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, etc...",positive
10729,5.0,This is a better option then the fire stick for your main Tv. The fire sticks are good for bedrooms but the fire TV has 4k and is much faster. I like that it can be wired to get the max speed from my internet.,positive

10731,4.0,Recommend you buy the box not the stick. Better!!!,positive
10732,5.0,"I went to Best Buy to purchase a fire stick, but they were out of stock in the area. When I asked about the fire stick, the sales person mentioned how the fire tv might be a better option due to faster streaming and video quality.

I have basic cable and my son can play video games and we can also stream to the fire tv. This is an amazing product.",positive

10739,4.0,"FireTV box is a lot better than the FireStick...Awesome device, just had an issue with one firestick freezing up a lot but was easily returned when i brought it back to the store. no verification was needed and they exchanged it for a new one. I use them to have Kodi on them and i have a total of 4 in different rooms. They do freeze up sometimes when running a big build or a big app on them which gets annoying... then i use the FireTV which is better and can handle more than the stick can.",positive

10763,5.0,It was a gift to each of my children (3) for anniversaries/birthdays. They all love it for variety of movies and ease of setup and use. No complaints.,positive

10777,4.0,Really enjoy it . Would recommend it to others. Thanks,positive
10778,5.0,Hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick. I bought this to replace my previous one that only did 1080p. Having had both I would say you won't go wrong with either. I bought the firetv for the direct Internet plug in capability which I figured would be a concern with wifi,positive
10779,5.0,I love this! Easy to set up and easy to use. Would recommend it for sure.,positive
10780,5.0,I would highly recommend this product!! I wish that I had purchased this item a long time ago!,positive

10782,5.0,"I've only had one box failure since I cut the cable cord years ago and Amazon stood by replacing it because it was an odd occurrence. I have several of these -- they work great not only with Amazon features, but with Hulu, Netflix and other streaming media options. I tried a Roku unit from a friend once and didn't like it. The Fire TV, on the other hand, is very easy to use.",positive
10783,5.0,"This is much better product than the fire stick itself. I was able to connect it via wifi or via the Ethernet port. Fast easy and watching tv in less than 15 min out of the box! Also, you can download the remote to the fire tv for IOS. (Comes in handy when someone misplaced the remote)",positive
10784,5.0,"We have a tv that already has Netflix and Amazon but still wanted all our other apps that you just can get on other devices. We love this this thing and highly recommend it just ask Alexa for stuff instantly you have music, movies, and shopping.",positive

10789,5.0,I bought the Amazon Fire TV to mod and stream media. It works fantastic and does exactly what I want including 4k video output. The primary reason I chose this item over the Fire stick was that I wanted wired ethernet and not wireless. Picture quality and sound is excellent.,positive
10790,5.0,I got this for my mom who wanted to cut down on her cable bill. It has worked great!,positive
10791,4.0,"I own all three of the latest Fire TV, Roku and Apple TV. Out of the three, as a pure streamer, I'd say Roku is probably my favorite followed by Apple TV and then Fire TV. However, as a multi-purpose device, the Fire TV wins hands down and it's not even close. The Fire TV allows you the most customization, freedom and versatility, such as the ability to side-load apps. Both Roku sand Apple TV are locked tight in that regard. Fire TV also features a more baked in Prime experience. The Fire TV can be a little slow sometimes and can freeze occasionally (more so depending on what you install), but overall, not a bad box for the price.",positive
10792,4.0,able to access movies and TV--easy to use/easy to set up,positive
10793,5.0,"I haven't used it a lot yet, but the few times I did, it works great. It was easy to set up. Looking forward to be able to bring this with us on trips.",positive
10794,5.0,"Great product! Easy to use! ihave Sony Vue tv service, Netflix and Amazon prime. Using all of these with just 1 remote makes things easier.",positive
10795,4.0,"So far, works just as it should. Haven't used it over WiFi, as I have it direct connected to my modem. I love that it came with a remote, but wish it could use a universal one, but the phone app works just ads well, too. Wish there was an off button, not just sleep mode.",positive
10796,5.0,"Its amazing, super fast in response and will provide access to all your amazon content. If you are a prime member this is a must IMO!!",positive
10797,5.0,"I purchased after owning a FireStick for a while, which is now moved to a different room. Works great so far and runs smoother than the stick.",positive
10798,5.0,I wish I had purchased this a earlier. Fun for the whole family.,positive
10799,4.0,"Compact, Fast, Reliable .... Very GoodI am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):",positive
10800,5.0,I have several kindles and so this time I choose FireTV. It is good quality and it works as promise.,positive
10801,5.0,4K Netflix streaming is awesome. Tons of available apps. Remote works well. Gets kinda hot after a while but doesn't seem to be affecting performance. Would recommend!,positive

10803,4.0,Product does not disappoint. It does what it says.,positive
10804,5.0,Amazon TV is a great streaming devise and it has voice control.The Fire TV also streams in 4k,positive
10805,5.0,"This things is amazing. I had a Roku and a Matricom G box before it. It's fast, has expandable storage, usable USB ports, and you can easily side load Kodi. The only gripe I have is that there is no IR control, so you can't program it to a smart remote. I do like the fact they make an app for iOS and Android so that make it a bit better, but it would be nice to have one remote control I can use to control everything.",positive
10806,4.0,I purchased this to watch Amazon Prime programing and Playstation Vue.This is way faster than the Fire Stick. Although I still have occasional glitches I can't for sure say its from the Fire TV versus the services.,positive
10807,5.0,great product. I have 4 android fire TV boxes in my house. I love it. easy to setup,positive
10808,5.0,"After reading many reviews on the other competitor products and even purchased another one that was much more expensive and complicated to install and operate, we decided on this one and could not be happier. Easy to install, operate, and has many features that we use daily. A big plus if you are an Amazon Prime member. Although the family uses this mostly for tv and movies, I use it mostly for listening to music. It is fast and we now have the unit on two tv's. We also gave one for Xmas.",positive
10809,4.0,After a lot of research I purchased the fire tv. As far as t know it is one of the only if not only streamers out today that after its latest update can force dd+ to downcovert to regular dd 5.1 over HDMI great feature for soundbar and legacy receiver owners. I do not have a 4K tv so that is not important to me. All else works great out of the box this unit had a lot if bugs in the beginning but except for lack of vudu I love it. Being a prime member also helps.,positive
10810,5.0,"This is really the best streaming device it has all the services like netflix, hulu, and it also plays games. I love this fire tv. Its also 4k.",positive

10820,5.0,What a excellent strean=ming player and with the 4k resolution goes great with my Samsung 4k tv,positive
10821,5.0,Love the new Amazon Fire TV. It is real fast and the thing I like best about it is that you now can put in a SD Memory card for a lot more space. Cheaper and better then the new Apple TV.,positive
10822,4.0,In my honest opinion spend the extra money on the FireTV and directly connect it to your router. If you have Brighthouse internet then you'll understand why. Their hardware constantly has wifi issues. So much happier that this plugs directly into the router and my streaming is no longer interrupted.,positive
10823,2.0,From the beginning we've had issues with our remote,negative
10824,5.0,"at first view I was thinking too much to get or not get this product, but I tried and I love it... Amazon Video is the most amazing video library paying yearly and enjoy at home :) Love this product.",positive

10839,5.0,This is a great device for your transition off cable. I recommend slingtv to help the transition. I have the firetv as well as the firestick. Spend the additional money for better wifi.

10875,5.0,Easy to setup and use!! Would recommend to anyone looking for a convenient way to add a Smart TV to their home!,positive
10876,3.0,"This is a very wonderful streaming product. It is fast and has numerous app capabilities. There are some flaws though. The remote sometimes doesn't work then you'll have take out and put in the batteries, but you can use you're phone as a remote, it is faster and easier that way too. And it doesn't support VUDU or Crunchyroll. You can only real put this divice to its full potential if you're a Amazon prime member",negative
10877,3.0,Great for streaming movies to your television. ...,negative
10878,5.0,I own 3 firesticks for every tv in the house never had a problem with any of them . Wanted upgrade and saw some reviews online and I'm glad I got my hands on the firetv. With a faster processor expandable memory is just perfect for kodi the next. Big thing next to the nvidia shield which I own as well. I will definitely recommend it .,positive
10879,5.0,"What a difference and got a super deal before Christmas. The new Kindle Fire not only does UHD with my monitor, the interface is really nice. I think it's much better than the Roku 3 I have been using and the Roku 4 that couldn't recognize my UHD HDMI port. It would only do 1080p. Plan to buy another to replace my Roku 3, for a 1080p TV. NICE!",positive
10880,1.0,I had no cable but had internet so I thought this Amazon item would be good. Basically you have to pay for each subscription to use this making it super costly. I retuned this and just use Netflix with a wifi enabled tv.,negative
10881,4.0,"I have used chromecast before; but heard a lot about its voice remote and other benefits. So, purchased this one. It is good; but i loved casting from my browser. It doesn't have default browser or in app store. probably I can install one using adb. Also, it is somehow slower than chromecast and takes a log time once it goes to sleep. I will recomend to someone only of someone knows adb and can add on apps.",positive
10882,5.0,"I would recommend this to anybody who streams on line, or uses Kodi",positive
10883,5.0,Works just as advertised. 4K streaming looks really good.,positive

10891,5.0,"Amazon has made a very affordable upgrade. Fast streaming, a responsive remote control and easy to set up. Picture is crisp and HD all the way. Supports 4K so future upgrades are a forgone conclusion.",positive
10892,4.0,"That's my only issue with it, vs the last one. But it was bought for a living room tv that does not use it so no biggie. Easy to install Kodi on. Just wish they would decode VC-1 files smoothly. Maybe the next gen?",positive
10893,4.0,"So far this has been a great product. Very easy setup and the remote fits nicely in your hand, similar to Apple TV remote but larger",positive
10894,5.0,This fireTV is the new 4k device. It allows you to sideload apps. It also now allows the sideloaded apps to have icons appear on the app menu. Amazing product. It has twice the memory as the fire stick. And it can be hard wired to your network. The stick is wifi only.,positive
10895,3.0,"The device itself is good designed.I'm Amazon prime member, but found that the amazon prime video/tv isn't that good. Can't find many good video to watch.",negative

10899,4.0,I like the flexibility and great responsiveness of the FireTV. Our family is able take advantage of the built in options (including Amazon Prime) and set it up just the way I like. I also have friends who prefer the Fire Stick. They have customized those and still have good performance. FireTV is great for anyone and even better if you are a little tech savvy..,positive

10903,4.0,"Works Great, Flixster is a little slow compared to vudu but at least I can still view my movies from vudu.",positive
10904,5.0,Debated whether to purchase this or not. Recently cut the cable cord. We also subscribed to sling tv and already was Netflix subscriber. Love this option. My favorite is the music stations. Most have lyrics to the songs I enjoy through amazons fire tv.,positive
10905,5.0,"I love my Amazon Fire TV. It's an amazing device! It's quick and very responsive. Overall, I believe it's the beat streaming device on the market!",positive
10906,5.0,"As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",positive
10907,5.0,I rarely watch live TV so watching my favorite TV programs on the fire TV works better for me. Also great for watching netflix.,positive
10908,5.0,"Easy set up, effortless, bout one for my 80 year old father and he uses it without any help.",positive
10909,5.0,Good and a lot of apps to pick from. And can connect straight to Internet,positive
10910,5.0,Great product and I'm in the process of cutting my cable tv.,positive
10911,5.0,Love hd qlty video awsome selection from music to tv shows,positive
10912,3.0,i was using the old fire tv but this one is better after all the updates,negative
10913,5.0,The tool is excellent with Ethernet streaming and smooth viewing of HD movies.,positive
10914,5.0,Way faster than the fire stick better over all connection,positive
10915,4.0,"Awesome video streaming device. Great picture quality, easy hook up. Out of everything this media device offers I must say the sound quality gets 5 stars. If you have this device connected to your surround sound you will not be disappointed at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I can't connect my hard drive to watch my home family video's the USB slot does not recognized my home movies on my hard drive or thumb drive.",positive
10916,5.0,This is a must buy!!!! Great picture you will enjoy this product,positive
10917,4.0,Gave as a Christmas gift. Have gotten great reviews about the streaming features and they love the voice remote!,positive
10918,5.0,I use to have the Apple tv and I like the fire tv more due to the streaming and voice activation. I have just recently purchased this item but the streaming is quick and it is very easy to maneuver through the channels. I have told some of my clients about the fire tv over the Apple tv.,positive
10919,5.0,Love the fire tv! It's is fast and very responsive. If you have Amazon prime this is a must!,positive
10920,5.0,Got it on sale.might have to get rid of my cable company.,positive
10921,4.0,"Ok so I tried the free trials for hulu, netflix and amazon. This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly. When I watch anything on it I make sure everything else that feeds from the modem is offline.",positive
10922,5.0,I bought it as a Christmas gift and the person enjoys it.,positive
10923,5.0,The processor and speed of this unit is unparalleled. As long as you have fast enough wifi (and a docsis modem) you will only get signal loss once in a great while; and it won't be the FireTv's fault. Love the plethora of apps available for various channels and the use of SlingTv with this box is a great option in place of cable/satellite.,positive
10924,4.0,They advertise zero lag time. Does still need to buffer,positive
10925,5.0,Great product built structurally solid no issue and purchased 2.,positive
10926,5.0,I have so many different apps that I use to watch my movies and TV and this device groups them all. The remote makes searching a breeze and Alexa is entertaining to talk to. I would get multiple of these. Amazon is adding a LOT of great features to prime. Oh and I hope you have PRIME when you get this. If you dont your wasting money. Get prime and get the fire TV,positive
10927,5.0,Great product. Easy to use and operate. Would recommend,positive
10928,5.0,"I purchased this device because I had the stick and I loved it. I knew this one has a faster processor, it would handle third party software better. I enjoy this product, it's really fun to use.",positive
10929,5.0,"Purchased the device when it is on sale, it is much better build than Matricom Gbox Q. Looking to buy another one when it is on sale.",positive
10930,5.0,I love this and use it every night to watch just about anything I want.,positive
10931,5.0,"Purchased for the TV in another room after cutting the cord. It's better than my Fire Stick, as this one comes with voice search and is ready for 4K. Best Buy has it on sale at $85, do recommend.",positive
10932,4.0,"I bought this to replace my Fire TV Stick because the wifi in my house is terrible. I wanted something that I could plug an ethernet cable into and I am NOT disappointed! The speed on this device is incredible! Very fast interface and I get much less buffering now that it is plugged directly into my cable modem. I did have to upgrade my router and change out my CAT5 for CAT6 cables, but that is more likely due to the speed going to the Fire TV and not the product itself.",positive
10933,4.0,If I purchased it at the sale price -- $25 cheaper -- I'd be giving it 5*. Amazon has a few kinks -- please focus on services I have setup -- but on the whole it's easy to find content.,positive
10934,5.0,If you have an amazon prime account this is the item for you!,positive
10935,5.0,Love this product will buy again this product is smooth and fast,positive
10936,5.0,"So far this is the best, least expensive media player I have found that meets my needs. Every media player can stream Amazon, Netlfix, Hulu ... What sets this apart is since it uses Android, you can actually do stuff with it if you don't mind side-loading some stuff. In my case, I use it to run Kodi. Why? Well, Kodi can play dvd iso files. I have bought hundreds of exercise videos over the years, and need the iso in order to use the menus. With Kodi you can do this. The last media player at this price point that could do this was the WD TV Live. This is that, plus plus plus. Highly recommend.",positive
10937,5.0,"I really like the voice control. It takes all the effort out of doing searches, without the annoying on screen keyboards.",positive
10938,5.0,"I'm happy with the product, all works perfect, but the Best Buy employee attitude I don't like, I'm ask for the product and he told me if you don't see here we don't have it, and I ask another employee and he show me the item from another place, a very different attitude.Thank you !!",positive
10939,4.0,"The controller and box are compact. The use of device is straight forward, but still requires a few days to become intuitive. There is a problem removing the battery cover, that allows replacement of batteries. It was immovable, and I finally had to use a pocket knife to pry it open, scaring the bottom of the controller. Amazon should have spotted the problem before going into production, accounting for the 4 star rating.",positive
10940,5.0,We don't have cable tv so this is a great way to get to see shows and rent movies,positive
10941,5.0,Love Amazon Fire TV. Easy and simple to use and set-up.,positive
10942,5.0,I got it for my brother and he loved it! He loved how small the box is and how it doesn't take to much space.,positive
10943,3.0,"Just like the reviews said, the Netflix app buffers every few minutes...AWFUL.....now I only have to glimpse that spinning red circle and my blood pressure rises. (I was hoping I would be one of the minority. =( ) . I finally yanked the HDMI cable and attached it to my computer to finish watching my program.I'm not returning the Amazon Fire-TV yet, because I recently acquired Amazon Prime and I've been hearing great things about their selection of movies, etc. Will update after I've used it for that.",negative
10944,4.0,Got this for a Christmas Gift and they love all the things it does. No complaints yet,positive
10945,4.0,"Great options, but could always have more. More apps!",positive
10946,5.0,The product is easy to use and loads everything quickly. The voice command works great and the 4k picture looks fantastic,positive
10947,5.0,Have a firestick and now a fire box and I am impressed with both products. The box however is a much more superior product. The speed is extremely noticeable and the expandable memory slots are a bonus. The ability to hardwire directly into my router makes for buffer free streaming. Well worth the extra money.,positive
10948,5.0,"Got this mostly for watching Amazon content buy it works well as a game center for mobile apps too. Can't say enough good things about it--haven't got a UHDTV so can't comment on 4k.Lot of experience with Amazon products so setup and connecting were easy for me. Travels very easily -- small and lightweight. Ethernet cable works best, obviously, but I found hotel wifi pretty effective for streaming too.",positive
10949,5.0,I really like it work great i recommended to my friends,positive
10950,5.0,"Buy this Amazon box and side load Kodi - so you can get free tv , box office movies and more ... Google Kodi and watch a video",positive
10951,5.0,"Had previously owned the fire tv stick to see how it would work, and i was impressed with everything it offered, so this full size Fire TV was just as good with faster internet (since it is now hardwired with ethernet cable) and has more memory. connecting was easy and everything was easy to scroll through. Having an amazon prime account gives you even more selections.",positive
10952,4.0,This is a much better alternative to apple tv.you can do so much more with this powerful machine,positive
10953,5.0,I have purchases 2 of the Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black.,positive
10954,5.0,Great device! Fast response with remote control. Great voice recognition! Very reliable in terms of connectivity. Streaming 4k is a big plus. Overall great product.,positive
10955,5.0,"Easy to use, easy setup, and nice interface. I would definitely recommend this product.",positive
10956,5.0,Great product haven't streamed 4k content as I don't have a 4k TV but it handle streaming of prime content and my plex server.,positive
10957,4.0,"works as described, but still needs some improvements such as more languages, more convenient menu... overall, it is one of the best TV boxes in the market now.",positive
10958,5.0,Very easy to set up.. Excellent remote and fantastic quality picture,positive
10959,4.0,"While definitely not a necessity, it is nice to have if you don't like going to the redbox all the time.",positive

10961,5.0,"This unit is far superior then the fire stick, it gets rid of the whole buffering scene :D. has option for wifi as well, get fire stick if you are going that route its the same thing but cheaper. Stream on :)",positive
10962,5.0,More memory and better processor than the fire stick! This is the way to go!,positive
10963,5.0,Great for all round entertainment. I connected it to my Amazon account and even my phone so o could view my pictures on the TV. I unfortunately had to return it because one of the purposes for which I bought it was not fulfiled.,positive

10965,1.0,Poor choice The product did not work after only one week it froze on me and I was unable to get it to go to the factory reset I would not recommend this product at this time I will call Amazon back to ask for my money and a refund after going on line I see that this is a common problem a problem that they should solve,negative
10966,5.0,this was a Great product. i would recommend this..,positive
10967,1.0,"Amazon is at the forefront of 4K content, offering several shows in HDR. Then why isn't their very own streaming player capable of displaying it? And at only 30 fps to boot. This was obviously built to a price but if you've already shelled out the money for a 4K TV wouldn't you want it to be able to display all that it's capable of? The Roku is, at present, the far superior product.",negative
10968,5.0,"I bought this for one reason, and thats Kodi, its an awesome device for that, and with the sd card reader its easy to install and get up and running, highly recommended",positive
10969,5.0,I bought this for my wife and she uses it every night before she goes to bed. She always watching Netflix or HBO go. Great investment.,positive

10985,5.0,This box is works great all the apps work and are responsive with little to no lag.

10987,5.0,I went back and forth but this was the right call.,positive
10988,5.0,"We upgraded to the 4K version. It has better buffering, and we love the voice search capabilities on the remote. It is super simple to set up and start watching your favorite programs. It also let's you add external apps like Kodi. Well worth the money.",positive

10990,3.0,"I purchased it to see if the stream speed would be quicker than my Amazon Firestick but was disappointed.The stream speed is at the mercy of your internet provider.The processing speed is faster than the Firestick but in the end it has the same memory as the Firestick.For the price, the Amazon Firestick is better if all you do is stream... It might be a good fit for gamers.",negative

11004,5.0,These is so much this unit can do......I do recommend this one over the fire stick (I have both) only because of the buffering issues. Didn't really notice a difference between the wifi and Ethernet cord plugged in,positive

11010,4.0,"So far, so good! It's been about 3 weeks or longer since i got it. I use it more than i thought I would. A good reason to justify the $100 for the Amazon Prime Subscription.",positive
11011,5.0,"Purchased the amazon fire to gain access to streaming such as amazon prime video. The device was simple to setup and is nice and sleek. I have had the device for about a month now and have had zero issues with it. Also, i purchased this at bestbuy and about a week later it went on sale at amazon. Bestbuy priced matched the sale price and credited my card. Good customer service.",positive
11012,5.0,This little box should be call a happy box. Once you have sat it up all you have to do is say what you want and it pop up on your tv.,positive
11013,5.0,Well worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account. Easy set up....excellent streaming quality. My only complaint is that I wish the speech search feature (there is a speech recognition search feature) worked with other apps.,positive
11014,4.0,"Store salesman recommended the Fire over ROKU which I had history with. Stated that you get more with FIRE. What I find is that they are very different in how they actually operate. ROKU is more user friendly while the FIRE is more tech savvy and can be open sourced to some degree. One is good for very computer knowledgeable on how to manipulate software and the other ""ROKU"" is better at a user friendly interface that is more preditable.",positive
11015,5.0,"Love these, great cable cutter. A little glitchy on the remote but really good product",positive
11016,1.0,Navigates easily. Many channels. Fast connection speeds.,negative

11019,5.0,"I had purchased the fire stick,but then decided to upgrade to the fire TV for more memory space and faster wifi.",positive
11020,5.0,"Upgraded to this from the Fire TV Stick, it's twice as powerful than the stick. I liked it a lot and got 3 of my coworkers on them and they love it. Great for travel, a dorm room & for not paying on extra cable/satellite boxes and their monthly vig.",positive
11021,5.0,"This is my second Amazon Fire TV product, first I had the Fire TV stick which was great but a little under-power so I went ahead and upgraded to the Fire TV box and I have to say that this box is great. The streaming picture is gorgeous!! I am using it hard wired so I can't talk about the Wifi, but the videos load basically instantly and it never looks pixelated. I installed Kodi and it works great!!, Alexa is very handy and can even do shopping lists for you. The only thing that I don't like is that the search feature on the box it only gives you results from the Amazon Video store, it doesn't give you results from Netflix, Hulu or others. It has a MicroSD card slot which is very handy if you are planning to download a lot of games, the remote works great and comes with batteries. Overall is a great box and if you have an Amazon Prime subscription is definitely a must!! You won't find a better and more organized Amazon instant video app.",positive
11022,4.0,Love all the options with the Fire TV. A lot of games and apps to help stop cable.,positive
11023,4.0,"fire TV works much better than Fire stick. The connection is more stable, the only problem is that the box seeems to go to sleep and does not recognise the remote. it starts working in a few seconds. it is just annoying",positive
11024,5.0,Great media box and you can do so much with it. Really fast and has 4K!,positive
11025,5.0,Excellent choice for watching television and movies,positive
11026,5.0,IN LOVE WITH THE FIRESTICK. SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT AND THE PRICE WAS NOT BAD FOR WHAT IS OFFERS.,positive
11027,4.0,Amazon updated their Fire TV box and this is a good option if you want a 4K upscale tv box.,positive
11028,5.0,"If you have Amazon Prime this is a no brainer. I have a 2014 Samsung smart TV and this works much better for streaming. It has wireless AC as well as N and connected to my AC network without any problems. It can also be hardwired to your router if needed. I really like the HDMI out which I can feed through my AVR the out to the TV just like a blu ray player. Connection was as simple as plugging it in and connecting an HDMI cable to my AVR. 4K streaming is glitch free and the voice remote works very well, too. Easily worth the 99 bucks.",positive
11029,5.0,"This is an excellent streaming device. It has all kinds of apps and other apps that you can download and you can even hack it to put Kodi on it. What I really like about the Fire TV box, over the Fire Stick, is that this box has an ethernet port, so you can connect it to the Internet, through a hard line, for a more stable connection than wifi, which means just about no buffering/load times, depending on the speed of internet you have. With wifi, you will have some more buffering/load times because the signal can fluctuate and go in and out sometimes. With the ethernet connection, the signal stays pretty consistent. Definitely recommend this.",positive
11030,3.0,"Fire worked fine and was simple to set up. I must add, however, that the overview menu should have more than a few on-line locations (Apps) like Netflix and YouTube. It should work as a main menu whose apps include things like liveTV, DiscPlayer, and even phonograph. Instead, it is pretty much all-Amazon. At least, if it was easy to access, it was Amazon. Aliza was not all that helpful either for non-Amazon material, certainly not for TV shows that are not in the Amazon library. I think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but Amazon. I was spoiled by my previous (Old Sony) BluRay Disc Player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything -- including Amazon. I may be showing my age and ignorance here, but I bet I have lots of company. I say KISS for usage, even if it means a more complicated install.",negative
11031,5.0,Item works great. Gets all of the channels and sites I am looking for and more.,positive
11032,5.0,"Set up was simple and was very pleased with the picture quality that streamed to the tv and since you can watch Amazon Prime movies, even better",positive
11033,5.0,Amazon fire adds a new dimension to tv watching. So much easier to use than other remotes.,positive
11034,5.0,love it best purchase so far this year better than the wifi fire stick,positive
11035,5.0,Great device for the price. Small enough to hide it and quiet enough to forget about it. 4K is the great addition that's on it. Compared to Apple TV you get more storage space for less on this and you get 4K too.,positive
11036,5.0,"The Amazon Fire Stick is a great way to access the vast library of Amazon and other content in any tv. You'll need an HDMI input on the television, a power outlet and reliable wi-fi. Get one for every TV in your house.",positive
11037,5.0,Now I have fire tv in all my room is. A great product you can do a lot of thing,positive
11038,4.0,I purchased this to watch movies and such on a led tv that doesn't have smart features built in and because of the ability to side load apps. Just an added bonus you can pair bluetooth headphones to the fire tv but not the stick,positive
11039,3.0,worth it to spend the extra 50 dollars and get the box w game control,negative
11040,5.0,Very pleased with the fire tv. Works faster than the fire stick. More bang for the dollar.,positive
11041,4.0,"I like how it works. It works well, I just don't like having to pay for everything.",positive
11042,5.0,This is one of the best purchases i have ever made,positive
11043,4.0,"I bought this for my son, and I'm going to buy myself one because I keep using his.",positive
11044,5.0,I was not satisfied with Chromecast because of its limited abilities. Fire TV with sideloaded apps can do so much more. Love it!,positive
11045,5.0,"Amazing! Easy to install and set-up. Voice control works well and controller fits easily in hand with the buttons in the right place. Got the first one for my wife at Christmas, we now own 4. Had 2 of the original Apple TV with small limited controller. That was painful. Amazon TV Is well worth the money!",positive
11046,4.0,I am also dealing with Centurylink at 30 speed. I am considering Time Warner at 15. This I am told will eliminate any streaming problems due to internet speed.,positive
11047,4.0,"Works good, easy to install and would definitely recommend",positive
11048,5.0,I have purchased a few of these items they are perfect for getting rid of tv,positive
11049,4.0,"I went with the Amazon Fire TV due to its flexibility to sideload Android apps but also be more forgiving than the regular Android builds. If you have Amazon Prime, this is the only way to watch it on an Android box. I wish Amazon would update its apps as quickly as the Google Play store does but overall, I have no real complaints.",positive
11050,5.0,Love it. Works great. Need good wifi signal. Easy to set up.,positive
11051,4.0,"It's basically adding ""smart tv"" to my ""dumb"" tv! A lot of free movies to choose from, some rentals seem rather high, but no biggy because there a lot of options out there for that. Love the lyrics that play with the music!!",positive
11052,5.0,"Works faster than the Blu ray Dvd/streaming combo like Sony or Samsung those were very slow streaming devices. I'm only on 3MBPS & the amazon Fire is a solid steaming device. I use Amazon video, Netflix, Pureflix,YouTube I've also seen a live event that streamed really good. Very impressed compared to the blu ray combo but it has its place but not for streaming anymore. Well done amazon and thanks to Best Buy .",positive
11053,5.0,"Hulu, Netflix and more on this device. Ethernet cord from router straight to the firetv device is 10x better than connecting wireless",positive
11054,5.0,"Works great. Easy to set up, watch youtube.com for it. Some streams better quality than others.",positive
11055,5.0,Very good treating device be able to installed third party apps,positive
11056,4.0,The Amazon Fire TV box is a wonderful device. I love the Alexa voice search feature. Wish there were more movie options for Amazon Prime members.,positive
11057,5.0,"Many of my friends raved about how well the Fite Tv performed and after months of hearing great things about it, I have to say this has been one of the best investments.",positive
11058,5.0,"Very easy to setup, internet reception is good using wired connection, 4K capable but 1080P is satisfactory.",positive
11059,5.0,"Could not say more great things about this product!!! Do yourself a favor and get this! It's so fast and while it has the same functionality as the Firesticks which I also own, you can hook this up directly to your internet router which makes streaming extremely fast!!! Make sure you watch plenty of YouTube videos and anyone can figure out how to get the MOST ;) out of all of the services Fire TV, the World Wide Web, and KODI (YouTube this) has to offer!!!!",positive
11060,4.0,Like responsive of the remote control. Great picture quality output (4K). Amazon prime has great video selection.,positive
11061,2.0,Good product and will definitely share to all my friends,negative
11062,5.0,I needed something that will easily connect to hotel WIFI cause I travel a lot so researched all devices and saw that the Amazon Fire was meant to connect to hotel WIFI with ease and I must that this device lives up to what it says it hooks up with to the hotel wifi with no problems great picture and fast steaming and I now use this at home as well I love it.,positive
11063,5.0,Enjoy using this as much if not more than the Apple TV,positive
11064,5.0,I am very happy with this purchase. It was super easy to set up. I especially love the voice control!,positive
11065,5.0,I brought the fire tv to get rid of cable. I'm able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows.,positive

11067,5.0,"I have used the Fire TV for a day, and I think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality.",positive
11068,5.0,"I already had an Amazon firestick, I really love this device because it operates faster than my firestick and I'm able to plug an Ethernet cord. Great buy!",positive
11069,5.0,great for movies.Works better with a bluetooth mouse,positive
11070,5.0,Just what I was looking for! Family love it! Will buy it again!,positive
11071,1.0,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV after owning the Roku 3 for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and Apple TV. I am a Prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice. However, the remote is very unresponsive, disconnecting more than it stays connected. The menu layout is very ""ad-centric"" and pushes you towards how Amazon wants you to view their service. When the remote works, the Amazon TV seems sluggish in comparison to the other products I tried. After several hours of fighting with the remote, I decided to return it and get another Roku...possibly the version 4. Good try Amazon, but far from being close to either Roku or Apple TV.",negative
11072,5.0,"After using the amazon fire tv for about two months, I can say that this is an excellent streaming device. I connected the fire TV to through the Yamaha receiver to my TV, therefore I get a perfect 5.1 sound. Amazon service is acceptable except the fact that they kind of force you to buy different subscriptions or buy movies if you want to watch the new stuff on the market. But here is the good news, you can use the device even without an amazon subscription - with Netflix, PBS, and so many other downloadable applications. With an 128 GB USB flash drive formatted in FAT32, this device may become an ideal player connected to your TV",positive
11073,4.0,I have bought this item because I was previously using the firestick and I was happy with those but the streaming would buffer a bit more than I'd like. So a friend of mine recommend it to me sand said little to almost no buffering. And it's exactly that little to no buffering. Even when streaming from my iPhone it's an amazing device. I really like it,positive
11074,5.0,"I really like the fire tv box. This was recommended to me by an Amazon sales rep stocking the store. My favorite part about it is that it plays 4K uhd video! Very fast and smooth, and actually takes advantage of the AC side of these new routers! Much better than using the apps built in to the tv!",positive
11075,5.0,Decided to go with the Fire TV because of wireless issues and couldn't be happier.,positive
11076,5.0,I have used different streaming android boxes and Apple TV over the years. Love this one. Starts up super fast and remote is very responsive. I mainly purchased it to use it with Kodi but I like how easy you can browse Amazon prime videos. I recommended it to a few friends and family. They all love it.,positive
11077,5.0,It's great since you can plug into an rj45 connector it's much faster than the fire stick,positive
11078,4.0,If you have amazon prime this is simply another way gaining more content If you are a cable cutter.. There's also the added plus of adding xbmc and getting additional content for content free.,positive
11079,4.0,"If you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an easy streaming box for the whole family to use, this is it. The lack of a few apps is a bit disappointing but Amazon is expanding their library as time goes on, so be patient.",positive
11080,5.0,"One of my best purchases yet...I have always been an apple person(still am), but this tv box is great. You can do so much with it. I just ordered a gaming controller for this unit. I have amazon prime and can watch so many tv shows and movies as well as listen to music. Great all around unit.",positive
11081,5.0,This item is great! We have an apple TV for our other TV in our house but this item blows it out of the water. the ability to access so many additional things and apps is exactly what we needed. Plus being able to access the Amazon Prime music options and TV/Movie rentals makes it so we do not need to run to RedBox any longer.,positive
11082,5.0,"I purchased this instead of the fire stick to pair with my new 4K tv. Easy to use, huge selection, small sleek design blends in to my entertainment system.",positive
11083,5.0,"sadly it's lacking youtube, it does do everything else do and does it all great.go here for easy kodi setuphttps://github.com/sphinx02/FireStarter/wiki/Install-FireStarter-and-Kodi-%28only-FireTV-needed%29",positive
11084,5.0,"Had an Apple TV, but as an Amazon Premiere member was missing out on a lot of free stuff. This is easy to navigate and filled in the gap.",positive
11085,5.0,"I love it, easy to learn and operate. Quick response and easy to hook up.",positive
11086,5.0,"I've had this for about a month and so far, it's all good. The remote that I can speak into is cool and most of what I say is recognized correctly by Alexa. I like that I can place Amazon orders this way if I feel the need. The only con, as of now, is that the battery cover is hard as h&ll to get off.",positive
11087,4.0,Works well and does what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it.,positive
11088,5.0,"I love my firestick, but the box is so much better",positive
11089,5.0,I recommend it Amazon-Fire This product is excellent ...,positive
11090,5.0,"I had the Fire Stick, ran OK did what I need to do but was slow, then I got this and it runs like a champ. plus a big factor why I wanted this was to Ethernet Port.",positive
11091,5.0,if you don't already have a smart tv -this is the way to go - Amazon has so many more choices than Netflix plus Prime gets you free shipping on top of free movies,positive
11092,5.0,This product is great! It allows me to watch whatever I want to watch from old TV shows to movies in the theater. I love this product.,positive
11093,5.0,I like that you can access thousands of movies or tv shows. Just make sure you have enough speed on your router.,positive
11094,5.0,I love my Amazon Fire TV. Just love it. This is better than regular TV,positive
11095,4.0,"Get Amazon Prime movies, Netflix, YouTube, but Apps are very limited. No Facebook. Can't get any good games that I know of and I don't need the Premium Movie channels because I get them with my cable. Enables me to use my older TV, which is not a Smart TV to access these services. Good deal. Might get another one for the guest room which has no cable box and the same type of tv.",positive
11096,5.0,Probably the best available streaming device. Would recommend this to anybody tired of apple tv's limits!,positive
11097,5.0,"easy to use, plenty to watch. Easy enough to set up.",positive
11098,4.0,"I was a little upset at first after purchase seeing that I pretty much need to be an Amazon prime member to get the full benefits of Amazon tv. On the other hand, It's way cheaper than having to pay a cable bill in the long run!",positive
11099,5.0,"I really enjoy amazon fire tv I get to watch Netflix, amazon prime movies and games. It has a very affordable price for a small box.",positive
11100,5.0,"From the small design, this unit packs big power. Although the newer model has an external memory port for sd cards that make this even better, the amount of endless apps, and movie choices(if you have prime) makes this essential. You can still order shows and movies without prime, and many apps are free. I would recommend the newer model and at least a 32gb sd card for heavy users, or if kids will be using it to download apps, as the internal memory runs out pretty quick.",positive
11101,5.0,This is one if not the bes streamer ever it has aGreat picture,positive
11102,5.0,This was my first experience with amazon fire tv. Setup was simple and quick. Quality of movies was quite good. One of the best features was its integration with Slingbox. Now I can watch movies or my own content directly to my Samsung Tv. Great product.,positive
11103,5.0,I love my Amazon fire tv box! I use it for everything u could dream of! It works amazing with a prime membership and has many different uses like playing games and what not!! It looks amazing on a 4k tv..,positive

11107,4.0,"It's ok, I didn't know that I would have to pay for movies",positive
11108,5.0,If you want to cut the cable and go from your cable plan to a much more common sense one utilize this magical little box. Not only can it be loaded up with the standard TV apps it also makes a pretty great gaming system.,positive

11112,5.0,Best investment I made. Will buy one for every tv in my house,positive
11113,5.0,"Bought one of these to get something to try out Kodi, as a streaming media device it works really well. I love the fact you can have your Netflix and other apps right at hand, I can still run plex and Kodi installs In a matter of minutes. Nice to have a single device to run all my needs and totally replaced the need for cable. The sticks work well but the extra grunt of this is worth the additional spend.",positive

11122,5.0,Very nice good product and the picture quality are very nice,positive
11123,3.0,Not much of a selection for shows or movies. Hopefully changes,negative
11124,5.0,Good buy! This is the best streaming device out in the market today.. Its really worth every penny,positive
11125,5.0,If you know anything about the android OS and what you can run on it this is the device for you!!,positive
11126,5.0,I wanted to cut the cord from satellite tv and search for a lower cost alternative. I LOVE the Amazon Fire TV. Easy to set up. Only disappointment is I can't watch all of the same programs/channels I did on satellite TV. I am saving $120/mo since I cut the cord!!,positive
11127,5.0,love the fire tv.. super fast uploads. Small and compact,positive
11128,4.0,"Unit is nifty for some functions, it would be good with a prime membership. I expect a little more usable content without additional purchase for the price tag. Still have not fully explored the unit.",positive
11129,3.0,the concept is great! We have had some issues with certain streams being unplayable and it is sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. There needs to be an easier way to maneuver and find the things you want to watch.,negative
11130,5.0,"I just bought a 4K tv so I wanted to make certain that I obtained a media player that delivered 4K content. I looked that the Roku, Apple TV, but I settled on the Amazon Fire TV because of my previous Amazon account and the price point. The device is quite elegant with a small form factor. The remote is equally small and minimal in form but quite effective. The mic works great to interact with Alexa. Just for fun, I found it interesting that Alexa will answer a question comparing it to Siri, but Siri does not reciprocate.I like that Amazon has deals to allow HBO GO streaming on it, whereas my Sony TV was not allowed to thanks to some deal between Comcast Xfinity and the networks. Other apps such as Youtube and Sling also work just fine on the app. It also syncs up to your Amazon account and on some songs, lyrics will appear on the screen like some sort of karaoke service. I thought that was a nice feature.I wish there were a few more options on it to customize loadout or app management. Also, at times the device would disconnect from my N network and connect to the G band for some reason, forcing me to manually reset it. I wish it would automatically connect to the higher band, but it's a minor complaint. The bottom of the remote can scratch easily as well, so don't slide it across the coffee table as I am apt to do.Overall, this is a great product and I have no regrets purchasing it.",positive

11132,5.0,Once I figure out all the options I will be able to save money on my cable bill! It offers many channels and movies. Plus you are able to sign up for subscription channels as well. The downside is that it is only on one tv or maybe I just haven't read enough yet!,positive

11140,5.0,"I've always used AppleTV but now that I've started using this, I got to it before my Apple TV. More options to choose from. And I can still cast my MacBook to it! (Gotta install an app though) but I like it.",positive
11141,4.0,Allows me to decide if I want to stop using TV providers,positive
11142,5.0,This is by far the best streaming device around. My Chromecast was just given to someone free of charge. That was a waste of money. There isn't much you cant do with this. Couple this with a Prime membership and by by cable.,positive
11143,5.0,"Great product! The FireTV is very easy to use but requires the user to setup an Amazon account. This can be a free or prime account. The FireTV easily connects to your Wifi giving you access to Addons, games, music, movies etc. The voice controlled remote control makes searching for your favorite content easy but if you prefer, you can use the navigation features instead. Parental controls are provided if needed. There is also a video you can watch that shows a sample of the features this devise offers. Great purchase. I even took camping using my phone as a hot spot powered by a generator. The FireTV worked perfectly.",positive

11148,5.0,"4K, quad core, 4GB ram, USB and MicroSD, voice remote...this box is a monster. Bonus if you are part of the Amazon Prime world...if not, still get one, it runs circles around AppleTV. Plus, these can be modded, if you are savvy enough.",positive
11149,5.0,"The 4K model exceeded my expectations as far as a streaming media player for the home entertainment system. It is easy to use even for a beginner. I like the voice command remote feature which eliminates a lot of button pressing. There are a lot of apps availabe and it integrates with Amazon prime customers. Overall, I highly recommend this box to those who like to spend a lot of time in front of their tv.",positive

11154,5.0,"Wow says a lot. We are already prime members and love the normal benefits, but this box added to the list offering a huge selection of things to watch.",positive
11155,5.0,"I had previously purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick, which worked OK, but was lacking in some areas. I upgraded to the full-blown Amazon Fire TV mainly because of the faster Wi-Fi that is included. It makes a substantial difference when streaming HD content. Additionally, this unit has a faster processor and more memory than the Fire TV Stick. To me it is well worth the extra $$.",positive
11156,5.0,I had the fire stick before buying this and though I liked the fire stick i thought it could be faster. The fire tv definitely bumps up the performance a bit and having the voice search really helps a lot and makes it better.,positive
11157,5.0,"I have been and Apple TV guy from the start but was disappointed they chose not to include 4K on there latest model. So I thought I would see what Amazon had to offer. Wow the 4K content available is awesome and growing everyday. All the menu's are easy to use and set up. Very, very, happy with this purchase.",positive
11158,5.0,"The device itself is funtional and gives you access to many types of services ex: netflix, hulu, amazon prime, and much more. It also allows you to customize it by side loading programs. Its not a bad little device but I prefer its big brother the amazon fire tv.",positive

11165,4.0,"Good job Amazon great product easy to hook up and start watching movies, sports etc.",positive
11166,4.0,"Bought this for a bedroom TV. The interface is geared toward Amazon Prime members, so most of the items on the main screen are of no use to me. You must do some scrolling to get to the APPS page. So for people who aren't Prime members it's not as convenient as other streaming devices. My solution was to install Firestarter.I would have bought a Roku, but Amazon Fire is the only streaming device to support the TIVO app. So unless I wanted to spend quite a bit more for a Tivo Mini + Roku, this was my only choice. But after installing Firestarter, I'm satisfied. The Tivo app does not do everything a Tivo Mini does, it just allows us to watch recordings from our Tivo Bolt in the living room.Had it come stock with a display option to switch to a less prime-specific startup screen, i would have given it 5 stars. But Amazon is trying to promote Prime, so that's not going to happen.",positive
11167,3.0,Apps and streaming run great. Searching and growing movie and show selection could use some tweets.,negative
11168,4.0,Seems to work even better and faster than the fire tv stick.,positive
11169,4.0,"This version has some advantages and upgrades compared to the previous version, but it is missing the optical audio out. Outside of that the device works fine, just not a fan of Amazon's version of Android. Still a good deal for what it is.",positive
11170,3.0,Good productThe only thing I don't like is that the remote is unresponsive some times. All in all good steaming device.,negative
11171,5.0,"I have always wanted to get the best products for the money for my audio video experience. The Amazon Fire for 4K has not disappointed. It was exceptionally easy to set up and attach to the internet and my TV. The updates for the Fire are seemless and fast. The visual quality is what was expected. If you already own the Fire would I recommend the upgrade? Do not know, but wish there was some sort of buyback program and then the choice would be easier. I do like the gaming ability of the system but have yet to explore those options extensively.",positive
11172,5.0,"Excellent way to view tv. Amazon Prime, Netflix & others. I've tried using the others and this is the best.",positive

11177,5.0,This is just what is advertised on the box. It was very easy to set up and use.,positive
11178,3.0,"I really love how this product works. It is fast and easy to use when the erthernet cable is connected to the router. The WiFi distance to the router is very poor. You almost have to put it next to the router. My TV is about 50 feet from the router and I am able to use nextflix WiFi without any lag, but the Amazon fire TV is not in range. It is in range right next to the router.",negative
11179,5.0,Works great and very happy with it. We arte going to get another soon. We used zip ties on the back of a TV so you don't even know I it there. I prefer to add this to a TV then buy a smart TV.,positive
11180,5.0,This is on of the best media players on the market.I have cromecast and roku and this is the tops .,positive
11181,5.0,"This streaming content box packs a lot of punch for it's size. Very responsive to your commands whether using handheld remote or voice activation. Very easy to set up, register, and use.Some of the content is a little misleading as you need to look for the prime banner otherwise you have to purchase to watch which was a surprise for me as when I saw all the selections, I was excited about all the offerings. Some of the movies I wanted to see, weren't even available. But there is still plenty of other stuff to watch. I'll give it a year trial to see if its really worthwhile, but seems ok so far when you bring music content and free 2 day shipping into the package.",positive
11182,4.0,"Got it home, was able to set it up in a few minutes.",positive
11183,5.0,much more powerful then the stick and the amazon fire tv 1,positive
11184,5.0,"Amazon Fire TV is a great media streaming device. I made the decision to cut the cable when Sling TV started providing the ESPN family of channels on its app. But the question was: which device to get. I was already an Amazon Prime member and had a Netflix subscription. So I needed to find a device that had those apps, plus Sling and Hulu. Amazon Fire TV and Roku 3 were the only devices to carry all the apps that I was using and wanted to use. I read many reviews and both devices seemed to be good. So I rolled the dice and got the Amazon Fire TV. It was super easy to connect to my TV and Home Network. I was up and running in under 5 minutes. Haven't missed cable tv for a single minute. I like Amazon Fire TV so much that I got a 2nd unit for another television in the house. With a good HD antenna and streaming media device, you will never miss cable! Best of all, I am now saving over $100/month.",positive
11185,4.0,It works pretty goodwork properly with the right Internet speed,positive
11186,5.0,This product has surpassed all of my expectations for these add on tv devices. I originally had a Roku and I have to say this is 10 times better. You won't regret purchasing it.,positive
11187,5.0,I had bought one for my bedroom back in december of 2015 and bought another one for my living room. I am a cord cutter and have zero complaints about this product. I have amazon prime as well so that adds even more to the amount of shows I can watch. Love it!,positive
11188,4.0,"I had the first generation FireTV and it was great. I wanted something that was a little faster for playing games and also for using with Plex. Plex works so much better on this generation than the first. More of the videos that I have can be played direct instead of being transcoded. Games also seem much smoother on this device than the first generation but it is hard to tell due to the limited types of games on the Amazon App store. If you are looking for a device that can stream Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Prime Video, and ESPN and still be used for casual gaming then this is the device for you.",positive
11189,4.0,Nice amazon fire tv ... Super quad core processor good box to see apps,positive

Log in to your amazon account and Netflix and Hulu and you have tons of options right at your fingertips!Have not really used alexa all that much so not sure how well it works overall. The phone app remote works pretty well so that is nice when you cant find the tiny fire TV remote/ too lazy to look for it! :) Some of the apps do not work all that great/ don't utilize surround sound but the main ones do.

11209,5.0,"Up until now I had been using different android boxes to stream movies.I had read that the Fire Tv is very quick and capable of 4k, which is better than the expensive apple tv.

11258,4.0,Great product. Would be nice to have the Xfinity go app and vudu.,positive
11259,4.0,Bought the Fire because I wanted to get Vue from Playstation which will not stream on Roku. First of all I do not like the Fire's layout. It is very cluttered and harder to find what you are looking for than on Roku. Also I had trouble with the streaming and extreme amounts of buffering while on WIFI. My modem was only a few feet away from the Fire. Roku almost never had buffering/streaming issues. I had to plug the Fire directly into the modem in order for it to work. This did take care of the buffering problems. I gave it a good for working when plugged into the modem. For WIFI only it would get a rating of POOR. I am very glad I did not get the Fire Stick because it probably would have had major buffering issues. If you are getting VUE and need the Fire I would recommend it. If you are not getting an app that needs to be on Fire than I would highly recommend the Roku. Roku is highly superior to the Fire.,positive

11288,5.0,"The amazon fire tv box is by far my favorite box. We have roku smart tv's ,chromecast, fire tv sticks and a few others and the fire tv Box gets used so much more than the others. The beauty of this box is not only does it work wonders if you have an amazon prime account , but you can add any android app to it by simply side loading it using an android phone or your computer. The interface is very user friendly as well. My 3 year old navigates it by her self just fine. I would recommend this box over roku or nexus player.",positive
11289,4.0,"It is super quick, alot faster than 2014 version. Alot better video quality imo",positive
11290,5.0,Easy to navigate with plenty of apps. Simple connection,positive
11291,5.0,Works flawlessly and love it. Great options and apps.,positive
11292,5.0,"I found the Fire TV to be a great buy!! I love it and take it everywhere I can. Note that Prime TV does not work in some countries overseas, Netflix does so we still find a lot of things to watch when on the road. You can rent movies on Amazon (paid) but no Prime unfortunately. Other than that and if you are in the US, no problems and highly recommended!",positive
11293,5.0,I have fire stick for few years and using it everyday. My smart TV is less smarter than it. I don't use the smart function of the TV. I purchased fire tv month ago and I can't live without it. An excellent product from Amazon. Highly recommended.,positive
11294,5.0,It works great I love it. I used to have a firestick and this was an upgrade.,positive
11295,4.0,"I love the Amazon Fire TV. I chose it over the the Fire Stick because I have 4K TVs.The picture is crystal clear. You need a strong Internet signal in order to Strem Effectively without all the buffering.This is a great option if you are tired of cable or just don't enjoy paying the high prices. You can access your favorite streaming Apps. (Hulu, Netflix, etc.)",positive
11296,5.0,"I was first introduced to this product by a friend and ever since I had seen what it is capable of, I not only bought one, but two! I have referred this device to several family members along with friends and they all agreed how impressive it is.",positive
11297,5.0,"Fire tv is good for watching prime movies, but great for making a easy Kodi box.",positive

11299,5.0,Used the fire sticksBut the upgrade in the box from the stick is amazing Would still recommend stick for starter,positive
11300,5.0,This Amazon Fire TV Box is perfect for Kodi and is really fast,positive
11301,5.0,I had purchased a fire stick before I purchased the fire tv and it would freeze up and crash after long usage fire tv runs great.,positive
11302,5.0,This is one of the best box out there in the market. I purchase many different boxes but this is far suppirior quality then others. Good value for the money. Only complain about price should be more compitetive otherwise you will not be disappointed.,positive
11303,5.0,The Amazon box works so much better than the fire stick less lag and buffer.,positive
11304,4.0,I thinj its a but overpriced. If i knew better would have opted for the flash,positive
11305,5.0,This little box is awesome. If you have Amazon Primeits a must have and even if you don't it's still worth it's weight in gold. Sure just about every device can play Netflix or any of your other streaming services but this thing is quick. With Prime you can also add Starz or Showtime for an additional fee and that'll give you access to all there content from this things native interface no other apps needed.,positive
11306,5.0,"Best option out there for a plug and play device. The system is easy to use, set up, and is fast. I highly recommend the firetv over the fires tick, due to the power (much clearer feed and faster response). I previously had a roku which I gave away after getting this device.",positive

11311,5.0,Much quicker than the fire tv stick! A nice upgrade,positive
11312,5.0,I would recommend this buy. Better than the firestick.,positive
11313,5.0,"We originally had a Fire Stick (and still use it with another TV). Once we subscribed to Sling, it seemed like streaming became more unreliable - increased buffering. We made two purchases to improve the situation: a Fire TV and a Wi-Fi booster. The two together definitely remedied the streaming issue. But the increased video crispness I/we give all the credit to Fire TV.",positive
11314,4.0,"I upgraded from the 1st gen Fire TV to get 4k. Happy I did, 4k looks fantastic through Netflix/Amazon.",positive
11315,5.0,Does everything I need it to and with great quality too! Couldn't have asked for a better product.,positive

11318,5.0,"This is truly a great streamer! I know you have other video streamers which are great and I'm sure they are but I used this video streamer for Pandora, YouTube, Netflix, CNBC, and Slingbox and I have to say, it is absolutely great. I've had no issues since installing it.",positive
11319,5.0,"This is my first time using any Amazon products, so far so good no complaints.",positive
11320,5.0,"Easy to set up. LOTS of free tv with this. If you're an occasional TV watcher and pay for cable or Sat service, you just be able to ditch them and put the $ towards something else.",positive
11321,4.0,"The Fire TV is an impressive device. There are tons of apps available and enough content for everyone. I recently cut the cord with Comcast and mostly view Prime content, which loads and plays quickly. The remote is super easy to use too. Great product and great value.",positive
11322,5.0,It is great to be able to watch movies commercial free and whenever we want.,positive
11323,5.0,From a fire stick to this speed difference is huge. KODI add on is a bonus.,positive

11327,5.0,Amazon fire tv pretty nice highly recommend. 5 star item.,positive
11328,5.0,Amazon Fire has a fast interface and offers all the services you would expect from a streaming box. The Playstation Vue app actually works better on my Fire than on my PS4.,positive
11329,5.0,"Next to the Amazon fire stick, this 4K fire TV is the best bang for your buck. I just downloaded a free app that allows me to cast whatever I have on my iPad onto my TV. If you want to save some money the FireStick is very good, just not as fast and no usb or SD slots to upgrade memory and download apps (or whatever) to.",positive
11330,5.0,You can't go wrong with this purchase. It works great and easy for kids to use.,positive

11333,5.0,Out at the farm we set up a ClearStream 4 antenna and got about twice as many channels that we wanted to watch (total about 50). We needed an interface for streaming and this works great. In addition it gives us a remote control for our Tablo to record the shows with no subscriptions needed. Total cord cutting!,positive
11334,5.0,Great product... One of the few to offer 4K streaming services.,positive
11335,5.0,"I've had the Apple TV, Cromecast, and Amazon Fire and Amazon has the most options that fit what I watch and use not to mention it has the best HD quality I highly recommend it",positive
11336,4.0,"Like the product. Video streaming looks great with no hiccups over wifi. Lots of supported apps: Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, and tons of others. And the Fire TV will support screencasting, just like Chromecast. I had a Chromecast, but didn't like the fact that I had to use my phone to navigate. And the Nexus Player doesn't support Amazon Prime. Voice control is also excellent.",positive
11337,5.0,Have used other streaming devices this is by far the best and easiest to use. Good tool to help cut the cable cord,positive
11338,5.0,"Great performing little device, easy installation and great picture quality.",positive

11345,5.0,"I have the Apple tv in one room and this in the other. Both are great boxes, but I must say this things absolutely flies when watching amazon instant videos. Almost zero buffering time even on 4K videos.",positive
11346,4.0,"I bought the fire tv for using my Sling TV subscription. It works great but the only thing I don't like about this product is we cannot install apps from external sources, I tried to install an external app which worked fine for 2 days and stopped working later giving me message that the app was not installed from Amazon app store.",positive
11347,5.0,"The Fire TV gives me everything I need from a media content perspective to watch shows and movies with several streaming media companies. Netflix, You Tube, etc. User interface is very easy. Going to be giving these as gifts for the family.",positive
11348,5.0,Awesome product. Everything works great and easy to use,positive
11349,5.0,This item was so great for our TV streaming needs we went back and bought another one for the other TV. Only down side is the remote is so small it is easy to lose. *beep* Alexa tell us a joke.,positive

11356,5.0,"Love this Amazon box, very great for putting Netflix and Hulu",positive
11357,5.0,This device is awesome. This was the first box we bought that allowed us to download whatever apps we wanted. The first apple tv didn't allow that. I also love that it is android and therefore much more open than apple. Amazon has a decent amount of stuff with prime that adds to netflix and hulu if you are into watching shows by the season.,positive
11358,5.0,Fast and easy to use. I watch Prime movies on it and also play games on it also. Best part you can add apps to it.,positive
11359,4.0,"This is my second Amazon Fire TV, I got the second one with voice remote, but I don't seem to use the voice remote option that often, but I do like the Fire TV and use it frequently.",positive

11365,5.0,"I wanted something to access Netflix on my older TV and this is a great easy fast device, but it so much more. I have an Amazon account and can also access my video library and on demand titles. There is also other TV apps and channels available also, if they add a couple more channels I would consider canceling my cable.",positive
11366,5.0,"I bought this Amazon fire TV to reduce services from my cable TV provider. The unit itself is small and unobtrusive. As I already have an Amazon Prime account, setup and registration were simple and straightforward. The unit works as it should. It is fast and the voice search works better than I expected. I have only had the Fire TV for a few weeks, so I cannot speak to long term reliability. So far, absolutely no problems with the unit. Fire TV is a great addition for Amazon Prime subscribers.",positive
11367,5.0,Works perfectly user friendly and has voice recognition. Don't waste money on a roku or nexus player. Definitely worth the money. Can do 4k and even non 4k much better picture quality.,positive

11370,5.0,"Having owned numerous streaming devices - Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, Fire TV stick and now Fire TV used on various TV sets in the house, I can say Fire TV is my favorite. The attractive interface and slick navigation, coupled with what I would consider excellent content, I truly enjoy my Fire TV the most.

11375,5.0,"I'm never paying for cable again! I'm so pleased with Amazon Fire box, we watch all our favorite tv shows and new. We have it all. And no $300 per month bill!",positive
11376,1.0,Bought two of these 2015 models to add to my previous model on other sets in the house. Both of the new units freeze after about 10 - 15 minutes stating that my 16 MB connection speed isn't fast enough for watching old documentaries from my Prime account. Cycling the power gets it working until it freezes again. The old model works flawlessly. I'll be returning these.,negative

11378,5.0,This device works as it is advertised to work. I'm very happy with this product. It is speedy fast processing and has great graphics.,positive
11379,5.0,"I started with Netflix and have since added Fire TV. Its good to have options and you get it by adding Fire TV. We use Fire TV more than Netflix currently, so I guess that is the best endorsement I can make",positive
11380,1.0,"I purchased the Fire tv box and it just stopped working one day. Wont boot, just sits at the logo. I spoke to customer service who could care less. They said the best they could do is sell me another box seeing that my warranty had expired. Its not like I bought this in 2012. Someone there even told me that if I have a ROKU box I can watch it with that instead. TOTALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Me an my wife are long time Prime members and expected a little more from Amazon. I am on my way to buy an Nvidia Shield TV for my streaming needs. BTW it doesnt have an Amazon app (wink). This is the first box I have ever owned that just stopped working.",negative
11381,4.0,More powerful then it's little brother. No hesitation at all. Love the fact that I can run a network cable to it instead of using wifi.,positive
11382,5.0,Excellent product to be able to see thousands of free movies if you are a member of Amazon Prime.,positive
11383,5.0,Wire TV works perfect if you want all of your steaming in one place.,positive
11384,5.0,"This product is really useful, got to use it at a hotel.",positive
11385,5.0,After several attempts to get help from Roku with no resolution I gave up and bought an Amazon Fire TV. This is by far the easiest to use. Love it!!!,positive

11390,5.0,Love it. Best decision ever right here . . dump cable and join the rest of the world.,positive
11391,5.0,This is the coolest technology I purchased since putting Windows 10 on my new laptop. I love being able to use the microphone to ask questions and request music. Combined with my sound bar they blow everyone away that comes to visit me.,positive
11392,5.0,I love it! I also have a fire stick. I got the firetv box thinking if I need to run Ethernet I can. But I've had no reason to. Processor is great!,positive
11393,5.0,"I recommend everyone get this special product. The fire tv is so easy to use my five year old daughter knows how to use it. Everything is straight forward and is easy as one two three in setting up. I have tried other media players and this one take top billing. What are you waiting for, go get a fire tv if you haven't already.",positive
11394,5.0,This works great. It is a great way to get rid of cable.,positive
11395,5.0,The 2nd generation fire tv is great for Amazon services. This is my second fire tv and I purchased it to stream Playstation Vue. I love the Vue service and the fire tv is much faster than the fire tv stick,positive

11404,5.0,Awesome product great value! I can stream from Netflix and Hulu and is much faster than the FireStick.,positive
11405,4.0,"This is great. It's pretty quick, it works, has USB connections for data, or for a mouse + keyboard, it's small, strong and neat. 4K is okay... but still not a ROKU 4 in terms of screen quality in my opinion. Although Fire is feels a little snappier, less noisy and heats less than the ROKU 4. I like it and will obviously keep it, but 4 stars just because there's room to improve it to be a nicer 4K streamer.",positive
11406,5.0,The best bang for the buck in streaming tv. Buy 1 for each tv,positive
11407,5.0,"THIS IS EASY TO USE, I ALSO HAVE A ROKU AND I THINK I LIKE THIS BETTER. IT TOOK ME A FEW MINUTES TO GET USE TO THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE ROKU REMOTE TO THE FIRE REMOTE, BUT NOW IT AWESOME",positive

11423,4.0,"I would have given this product 5 stars however the only thing I do not like is the limited amount of local storage space (8gb)...

The performance and speed is second to none, especially when connected to the internet via via hardwire Ethernet cable.. I recommend this product to everyone. Thank you.",positive
11424,5.0,"For starters i had the Amazon stick for a while & got tired of that due to all the buffering issues, but what can you expect out of that little stick? so when this went on sale, i decided to upgrade & i'am so happy i did, it works great & has reduced the buffering to a minimum, but like anything online depends on the site your on.

11429,5.0,The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent product. It has so many capabilities that I can never use them all. Connects both wired and wi-fi. I have Amazon Prime and get more free stuff that really expands the experience.If you have kids they can take the use to a whole new level.,positive
11430,4.0,"The Amazon fireTV is a good Roku replacement. It does push Prime and Amazon fee based content, but the Fire TV is smooth and has some nice features like Alexa (when you push the microphone button on the remote), free games, and voice search. Overall, it's a pretty cool product.",positive

11435,5.0,Great for Amazon Netflix etc... Even better for more advance users Kodi!!,positive

11437,5.0,"Easy to use, lots of apps. So far have really enjoyed!",positive
11438,5.0,"I got this fire TV because my fire TV stick didn't get good wifi reception in my bedroom. It has wired networking, so it works great! It's snappier than the fire TV.stick and does the same stuff.",positive
11439,5.0,It is Great. I use it all the time easy to use great product,positive
11440,5.0,Main reason for getting the Amazon TV was for better streaming experience of PlayStation Vue. The Amazon Fire TV handles Vue streaming w/o issues and the interface is very easy and user friendly. I also like the ability to root the device for third party apps.,positive
11441,5.0,Very useful and easy to navigate! Def recommend to anyone who loves to stream!,positive

11449,5.0,Works incredibly!!! I will never go back to cable/satellite again!!!,positive
11450,5.0,Easy setup. Loaded with many service/content providers. Some are fee based. Some provide free content. You choose which ones to view from. I only use the free ones. I would say that the quality of the streaming programs definitely depends on the quality/speed of your internet connection. So negotiate the best deal you can get for the fastest service you can afford. BTW... search the net to learn how to set this up with apps that allow you to stream stuff you never thought could be free. Enjoy.,positive
11451,5.0,"Great for streaming Amazon Prime amongst others. This is a must have, especially if a 4K tv is owned. Love it. Quick navigation speed, due to the memory and processor this box exhibits.",positive

11457,4.0,A welcome addition to online streaming. Easy menu and controls for navigation.No buffering issues noticed.,positive
11458,4.0,"The amazon fire tv is a really good streaming unit. I cut the cord about a year ago and I have a roku 3 that I also use. Only 2 complaints about the fire tv: 1) amazon pushes their services at you. If you can get past that, it's worth it. 2) the WiFi connection is not as strong as the roku 3. I've had to basically leave the fire tv upstairs (router is upstairs) and the roku downstairs. When I've tried to use the fire tv downstairs it buffers continuously. The roku has never buffered. I like both as both offer some channels not available on the other. I'll look into wifi-extenders so that I can use either throughout the house.",positive
11459,5.0,"Works great, allows the use of cat 6 and wireless use.",positive
11460,5.0,Items is very easy and a noob friendly. I love the item.,positive

11465,5.0,Great addition to my Home entertainment system. Would recommend.,positive
11466,5.0,"Having used a number of streaming devices, I would rate the Firetv as one of the best.Well worth the extra that a fire stick costs. Voice recognition is awesome and you can plug directly into your router to minimize buffering.",positive
11467,5.0,We love these so much we've put one on each floor of our house so we don't have to move them from our basement or living room.,positive
11468,3.0,"Nothing really great about it. It's basically a box to watch Amazon on demand. I have a smart tv, so to me this useless.",negative
11469,5.0,Work well with my televisions. I am pleased with this product.,positive
11470,5.0,Best investment I've made! Doesn't really buffer like the other sticks .,positive

11472,5.0,great product would definitely recommend fir other,positive
11473,5.0,"I cancelled my satellite service and bought the fire tv after using the firestick, and liking it. It's a great product, and with my amazon prime membership, gives us lots of viewing options, especially for the kids who don't mind not seeing the latest episode of their shows (we also signed up for playstation vue to take the place of our satellite service, which is available on the fire tv). The kids also enjoy all the games on it. The only issue is that many of the games that the kids want to play require a separate controller, which seems to always be out of stock whenever we think about ordering one.",positive
11474,5.0,"wel worth the upgrade from the amazon stick to the amazon fire.. more room to catch the memory buffer, lot smoother and a better control. works wonders making me one happy customer.",positive
11475,5.0,"I bought this for PlayStation Vue, and I am very satisfied with it. Highly recommend!",positive
11476,5.0,"I have enjoyed having the ability to watch almost any movies that I would like to see. This even includes movies that are being shown in the theaters at that time. Occasionally we have hit some streaming that tends to pause the show, but mostly we can find a go around by choosing another streaming!",positive
11477,5.0,"I love this streamer. The fact that all the apps I use are on this machine and the service from Amazon is amazing, it's very worth the money. Alexa is easy to use also. A recommended buy.",positive
11478,5.0,"Works great, highly recommend. Great alternative to cable",positive
11479,5.0,Friends of mine have one and said how great it was. I have the amazon fire stick in the house but thought this would be better in my living room. Easy set up.,positive
11480,5.0,This is thing is awesome next best thing to having cable the tv show and movie content is tremendous with the Kodi app I would highly recommend this to anyone Firestick or firetv ditch the dish and get Firetv!!!,positive
11481,5.0,"I love the fire sticks but sometimes not crazy about using wifi. The fire tv can be hard wired, which limits some buffering issues. Not that it's ever really been an issue. It's still really easy to use and setup just like the fire stick.",positive
11482,5.0,got one for me and for my older daughter. love it a lot,positive
11483,5.0,"I am an Amazon Prime member so the Amazon Fire Tv seems to be a no brainer. I took advantage of the Sling Tv offer where you prepay for 3 months you get $50 off of the streaming device. So, basically for $10 more you get 3 months of 20 channels, that's a good deal. Take advantage of it.",positive
11484,5.0,"love the easy set up, the navigation is very intuitive. Great to have access to all my music uploaded to Amazon Prime Music. Alexa works well too to play and pause music and shows.",positive
11485,3.0,"Set up was easy and load times and picture quality is amazing. The only set back is you have to purchase pretty much anything. I understand buying a movies , but to have to buy tv episodes is a draw back. I could just stick with my direct tv for that",negative
11486,3.0,"I got this because my fire stick always gives a warning that it is too hot. Haven't had this problem but did experience problem. I have my ps4, apple tv, running through a hdmi switch. no problem when I had the fire stick plugged in. The amazon TV will not work with the switch. For it to work it needs to be connected directly. I have three tv's and three different switches didn't work on any and yes I tried different chords. Other than that works great.",negative
11487,4.0,The product it's left works GREAT! Especially compared to the Stick. It is so much faster and has more memory that you are not constantly get the low memory notifications. Only problem is the lack of available apps on the App Store.,positive
11488,3.0,Can't stream smoothly unless plugged directly into the modem. Buffering was horrible (did not have this problem with Roku). Even plugged in it has some trouble with buffering at times. Only bought this because I got Playstation Vue and it only runs on certain systems. Unless you actually need the Amazon Fire to stream something only it can stream I would not recommend it. Roku is a much better system.,negative
11489,4.0,This item is one of the sweetest things I have ever brought.,positive
11490,5.0,Easy to set up and use. Love it for streaming you tube and other apps. Voice command is awesome!,positive

11498,5.0,Love the movies and songs it is a great product. Tx,positive
11499,5.0,this is my favorite set-top box. You have all the same functions as the others but you can also side load apps as well such as Kodi and emulators to play old school games like Super Mario and Zelda. If you have amazon prime the Alexa feature is pretty awesome as well finding music on prime and getting random information.,positive
11500,5.0,Easy to set up. Works great. Helpful tutorial. Would recommend over a Roku.,positive
11501,5.0,"I bought this to sideload Kodi on to it. A very wise choice, indeed! I no longer have to lug my computer out to my TV and attach via HDMI. It's ALWAYS on with AFTV! I haven't really used it for anything but Kodi and Netflix, but LOVE IT! Run out and buy this , NOW!",positive
11502,5.0,Great product just couldn't get my international chanels,positive
11503,5.0,"Love this thing, it's super fast and very little to no buffering when streaming my movies.",positive
11504,1.0,"Purchased for viewing Amazon prime. Loaded a couple apps and set it to sleep. When I returned a few hours later it was stuck in a perpetual boot and was not recoverable. I will get another as I like the features and price point, just a little soured by this first impression. I'm checking that I would not recommend to a friend but am hoping this will change with the second one. to be continued...",negative
11505,5.0,Super durable hardware that has endless features. From streaming to playing games. this thing is awesome,positive
11506,5.0,This is not our first Amazon Fire---we have them on every TV in the house (cord cutting) and over the years Amazon products have proven reliable. Best Buy was a great option for purchasing--they met the online price (their everyday price was exact with the online prices I saw) and I didn't have to wait for delivery.,positive
11507,5.0,I got this for running kodi and it does the job much better than the stick. Definitely worth the extra. Much faster and the Alexia on the remote is awesome.,positive
11508,5.0,"We bought the Fire TV box a few weeks ago to help save cost on cable tv. So far this has been a great alternative. We only have internet now and subscribe to Amazon Prime for around $100 a year. We subscribe to two other apps for $26 a month to get ESPN channels for basketball season and archived shows on CBS. The Fire TV box is easy to setup and use and there is also a Fire TV app that can be downloaded and used to control the box from a tablet or phone in addition to the Fire TV remote. There are thousands of tv shows and movies with the Amazon Prime subscription that are free.One nice feature is if we start a movie or show and don't finish one day we can go back the next day and resume where we left off. Another plus is the ""Alexa"" voice activated assistant to look up tv shows and movies and more just by asking. We have cut our cable cost by more than half. We did buy a digital antenna to get local tv in additon to the Fire TV box. So far we love our Fire TV.",positive
11509,4.0,I have a few of things and they all work great. Gonna get another one soon.,positive
11510,5.0,Loved it... great for streaming movies and tv shows. bought several of them for family and friends.,positive

11513,5.0,It is very easy to set up and easy to use. I love the slick looks.,positive

11515,5.0,It is a Great product and it was all I expected in this product.,positive
11516,5.0,I have Amazon Prime and this is a must for it. Very happy with it.,positive

11518,5.0,Its a great alternate for expensive canle tv services!,positive
11519,4.0,I had a older version of this product the new version is far superior and a pleasure to use compared to the old one,positive
11520,4.0,The only knock I have with this product is that it does not support vudu movie app. So...I have to connect to it through other means,positive
11521,5.0,I would encourage everyone to get this product to save on the cost of cable/satellite. A must have!,positive
11522,5.0,I went from an Amazon Fire stick to this tv and there is literally no lag in response time!,positive

11524,5.0,We love this option for home movies. Easy to set up and very user friendly.,positive
11525,5.0,"This little set top box packs a big punch, it is an absolute must for any media center. The processor is very fast compared to its counter part the Fire TV stick, no buffering issues and an expandable memory slot. You can also use wireless keyboards and a mouse to alleviate those remote clicks when searching for something. The voice activated remote is a beauty just say anything you want to it and it will look it up for you within the Amazon apps. This is a great add on to any entertainment center setup.",positive
11526,5.0,Amazon fire box all that and then some. Very satisfied with my purchase.,positive
11527,3.0,"Not sure what will happen if it gets dropped, Doesn't appear to adequately cover the screen, Looks really good!",negative
11528,4.0,"Replaced Uverse with Amazon Fire TV PlayStation Vue, good streaming, easy to use, compact footprint.",positive
11529,5.0,I bought this for my parents for Christmas and so far it does not disappoint. the ease of use and the selections are amazing. if you have amazon prime it links up even better and gives you access to all the videos and things it offers! great product.,positive
11530,5.0,"We go this for PlayStation vue. But with prime, there are so many options.",positive
11531,5.0,The fire tv works well with wifi or hardwired. Great for streaming netflix or sling tv.,positive

11533,5.0,Love it!!! I can watch all my shows on it and save money by cutting off cable!!!,positive

11536,5.0,"This device is like an all in one entertainment machine!! I really enjoy how easy it is to use and what is even better is that I am able to stream PlayStation Vue through this device.

11537,5.0,This is a great streaming device so many options. I love Amazon Fire tv.,positive
11538,5.0,I'm glad I made this purchase. I can now choose from hundreds of movies to watch. The Amazon fire tv allows for storing personal pictures and seeking assistance from Alexa. Great buy! I do not ever plan on paying for digital or cable TV again.,positive

11540,5.0,Love the new 4K Amazon box .. Looks great on my tv,positive
11541,5.0,I would totally recommend purchasing Amazon Fire TV! I have enjoyed the simplicity of use and the app I was wanting Plex ! Best Buy had the best price for it so I purchased it from there local store!,positive
11542,5.0,Great Product to use with a Non-Smart TV or a Smart TV which is not compatible with Amazon Music.,positive
11543,5.0,"best streaming device for the money,not very happy with the changes from amazon on blocking some apps.May change to a different device",positive
11544,5.0,This is one of the best streaming boxes I've had. Can easily interface it with kodi and also anything you may have on your kindle fire integrates as well. It's an awesome little box. Would purchase it again in a heartbeat.,positive

11550,5.0,Built in wifi support is much better than the fire stick.. Less buffering,positive
11551,5.0,"The interface isn't my favorite, but the unit is fast and responsive. It makes loading my son's favorite shows easy. Picture quality is great. I have mine hard wired to the router, so I cannot comment on Wi-Fi speed.",positive
11552,5.0,All I can say is wow. This is a really nice box. I would recommend it.,positive

11556,5.0,It does what it says it does. Straightforward to set up too.,positive
11557,5.0,"This device has been designed taking into account performance. In the past I used SmartTVs to see online content such as Netflix and Youtube, but the experience was always bad (slow response, hangs/freeze because of low memory, horrible interface and complicated controls). Now with the Amazon Fire TV everything works as expected: (1) Always ready, no need to shutdown, no need to wait, just turn on the TV and you are ready to play, (2) It's fast, very fast, no need to wait for loading apps, exiting or entering, (3) controls are very easy to use, very responsive - the multi-core processor is magic!Also, you can select from almost any streaming service you prefer (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Crackle, etc). Other devices offer less streaming options - is not because you need all of them, but you can change your mind at any point of time and you will not be stucked with your device.",positive
11558,5.0,This device is easy to setup very fast and provides a great quality picture.,positive
11559,2.0,"It takes a lot of time and subscribing to get the channels I want, so I will write another review next year when I got them all..hopefully !!",negative
11560,5.0,I just love this product. This is my 2nd and this is very flexible and open as against apple TV. I replaced my apple TV with fireTVs and I just love them.,positive
11561,5.0,"I bought this to replace an aging Apple TV and have been very pleasantly surprised with it. It streams in 4k, which my Apple TV did not do, and I have Kodi installed to stream media from a home server to my TV. Great product and worth the money!",positive
11562,3.0,Is a god but i have to pay 100 dollar a year is to bad,negative

11569,5.0,Great price and product is very good ..I will recommend anyone,positive
11570,1.0,"I bought this Fire TV 3 months ago. One day, out of the blue, it stopped working. Power is on but as soon after I see the Amazon logo the screen goes black. I google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it. I just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted 3 months before it became useless. Not a happy camper here!!!",negative
11571,4.0,I love Amazon Fire tv. It works well because it offers the Fox News and my shows I like on PS Vue,positive
11572,4.0,we love our fire tv. we highly recommend fire tv so much we cancelled our cable!,positive
11573,5.0,This product is easy to use and is better than any tv service u could get,positive
11574,5.0,"Better and cheaper than cable, the only thing I am missing is the closed caption",positive
11575,5.0,My only frustration is that you can't use a flash drive to view video or photos without purchasing a app that may or may not work. Other than that the product is awesome!,positive
11576,5.0,"I was using a Roku box and various game consoles before this for Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming platforms but the Amazon Fire TV really is the best option out there currently. The device is fast and responsive, includes tons of different apps and integrations and best of all has Alexa support for search. If you're a Amazon Prime member especially, this device is a must have.",positive
11577,5.0,Awesome product worth it would recommend it Anybody,positive
11578,5.0,perfect android box for your living room never miss a movie a sporting event or your favorite shows when you and Kodi just buy it,positive
11579,4.0,"I am definitely happy with my purchase. It's a very good android box, even if most of the content seems to be amazon content with the ability to sideload (install other android apps not from the amazon store) this makes one of the top android boxes. Also the ability to play some games makes it a plus. (just buy a microsd card since memory is limited to 8GB on this box)",positive
11580,4.0,"If your a prime member this is a must have. It does a great job streaming all of your prime media and your personal media. It does a great job with Netflix too, so if your an Amazon fan this is the box for you.",positive
11581,1.0,The supplied Amazon Bluetooth remote control will not pair back with the main unit. This is the second one I bought with the same issue. Re-Pairing the remote is quite simple per the instructions but to no avail. Had to use a android remote with a usb dongle to operate the unit. Going through batteries like crazy trying to get it to pair back up no more than three inches from main unit.,negative
11582,5.0,Great device for the amazon prime holder with 4k support.,positive
11583,5.0,"Easy to use reliable interface possible house hold money saver, if properly moded lol",positive

11587,5.0,"I use this device to watch Playstation Vue and SlingTv, amazing device, it streams SlingTv more smoothly than my xbox one, also the quality of video hardly ever drops, if it does its my internet and not the device. Great for the price, 100% recommended.",positive
11588,4.0,"It works will, some time it get slow to switch from Chanel to Chanel.",positive
11589,4.0,The fire tv box streams really well and might just be better than my Roku 3.,positive
11590,2.0,"I own a high end system with AppleTV 3 and Chromcast media players for Netflix and the likes. I purchased fire tv for 4K. As with other devices I thought I could configure it and forget it. This is not the case with Fire TV. Remote control requires constant attention. Open the back play with batteries, but battery cover back on. Constantly! HDMI port does not work with HDMI switch. It is the only device that I own that does not play well with my switch. Internet connection is poor. Start receiving video won't load errors after a week. I thought perhaps WiFi connection was bad even though no other device had this issue, so I tried wired connection and got same error. Tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help. Device is very hot. It is on constantly. No automatic method of turning off when not being used.On the plus side, the interface is the best I seen on any media player. Beautiful picture and screen saver which can be configured. Alexia rocks but limited to basic commands. Amazon Prime integration is excellent as you might expect. Beautiful looking device. After about 10 days I got fed up and returned it. I'll wait for AppleTV to integrate 4K. Hopefully that will be soon.",negative
11591,5.0,Product runs so smoothly. Way better than the fire-stick. And it allows you to do so much more.,positive
11592,4.0,"I'm loving my fire TV. I had a fire stick which I've since moved to the bedroom. I like that I can hardwire the box versus using only wifi on the stick. The biggest thing is that PlayStation Vue, Playstation's new TV streaming service, is only available on a few platforms and Amazon fire TV/ stick is one. So now I have my Hulu, Netflix, and PS Vue all in one place. The fire TV is a cord cutters best friend.",positive
11593,5.0,I bought this so I can stream the playstation vue app and it works great. Very speedy and seems to be faster than the Roku 4. I would highly recommend this if you are trying to cut cords and want a set top box for streaming.,positive
11594,4.0,"Got it on sale, works well but it's a bit slow when buffering.Overall we like it.",positive
11595,5.0,I would recommend this product to all my friends and family!,positive

11597,5.0,This device can do it all . The device also has nice voice command.,positive
11598,5.0,"I purchased this because I was looking for a device that could stream lots of content on a TV in the garage and let me tell you, this was money well spent, lots of great apps, plenty of streaming services, perfect for anyone looking for something inexpensive but still get a lot of features!",positive
11599,5.0,"I love it,that keeps them out of my living room so that they can watch tv in their room",positive

11602,5.0,"This is installed in a sewing room in lieu of a cable box with a monthly fee. She uses it with prime movies and tv shows (best of all, I don't have to watch)I did set it up and tried voice search. It works great>",positive

11604,5.0,Works way faster than my android box and is just awsome,positive
11605,5.0,Was easy to use and easy to set up programming was easy to do,positive
11606,4.0,At first I had Amazon Fire stick but I had too many problems with the screen freezing. Having some memory solved the problem. My router is in the basement 2 floors down. My only gripe is I haven't found a way to organize apps or shows like Apple TV. Got this so I could get PS Vue. Now I have programming I like in addition to Amazon Prime programming. I do get concerned with the possible data usage fees that major internet providers keep trying to impose. Otherwise I'm happy with the device.,positive
11607,1.0,"I have a pretty fast and stable internet connection, 65Mbps down.So when I tried to stream some 4K content, it kept buffering to the point that it just wouldn't load the video anymore. Even streaming 1080p content had some issues. So i used the dedicated apps on my tv to see if I had the same problem, nope. It worked flawlessly! This product just plain sucks.",negative
11608,3.0,"I was exited about it but got disappointed. Same old GUI , 4K is limited. Search option is only for Amazon ...",negative
11609,1.0,"I was so excited to start streaming 4k with this and the disappointment was terrible. It just never seemed to hit 4k while my Smart TV has no problem with it. The only reason I bought it was because I loved the original Fire TV and loved the setup. Also, it was glitchy and laggy. I gave it 2 days and returned it.",negative
11610,1.0,One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast. A quite large market of People affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it. What else can you not use it for I haven't found yet but Amazon has not written me back after I emailed them about this issue. Im stuck with waste of Money and will go get a Google Chrome now.,negative
11611,2.0,"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss. It needs to be specifically coded for this Fire TV (low bitrate, low fps) to work properly.- Overall system performance is bad. When sitting idle, the CPUs spike up to 60% usage and memory is at 60% usage. The OS is not well-optimized.I'm not confident that Amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon, so I'll likely return this while I still can.",negative
11612,1.0,"Basically has almost the same content as a Roku 3 would provide, but in a much more clunkier menu. I can get a better Amazon menu layout via the Amazon app on the Roku 3. Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.",negative
11613,1.0,Bought the fire TV excited about the 4K support. The first night it refused to load video content. I could only stream music. Now it refuses to load at all. It has completely stopped responding to the remote. Remote feels cheap.,negative
11614,2.0,"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice...",negative
11615,5.0,Works great. Have had no issues at all. Love it! :),positive
11616,2.0,For a device with 4k Technology they don't seem to advertise it much. You can barely see it on the box. Also search feature only works for Amazon. That's a waste of a search feature. Remote disconnects from the box often and your have to take the batteries out of the remote to reset it. I would not recommend until Amazon fixes the bugs.,negative
11617,5.0,"I have been using Amazon Fire products for almost a year when they first came out, and the 2nd generation Fire TV box is much faster! It is easy to use, and I can access all my favorite streaming video apps - and Amazon Prime services are great! There is so much content available with this device.Now adding Alexa integrates with the Alexa app on my phone. I can see my shopping list, which comes in handy.",positive
11618,5.0,I've had the chromecast for years and never really had any problems with it besides the occasional freeze when casting videos too big.Decided it was time to upgrade since SlingTV had a $50 promotion off any SlingTV capable device. The decision was probably one of my best purchases of the year. Now I can watch 4k content and stream videos without any lag.,positive
11619,5.0,"Love it. Was debating on getting it first, but have no regrets after using it.",positive
11620,1.0,I have 4 of the Gen 1 Fire Tv boxes and they are good showing their age. I purchased the new FireTV only be to disappointedPros.. SD Card slotCons.. Many Apps just don't work or are buggy...Search is terrible and only gives Amazon options .. Nvidia Shield also gives my plex server option .. now that is cool... not much faster.. if at all than Gen 1,negative
11621,3.0,"It kept freezing when I first hooked it up. I couldn't type anything in because it kept resetting. After a couple days it started working, when I was ready to return it, so I decided to keep it. Need to be patient with it.",negative
11622,4.0,The box needs a 4k tv for maximal viewing pleasure. Will not turn your tv into a 4 k machine. Sure will help a little with graphics. If that where the case people would buy cheaper tvs then this box. And it is much faster than original. I have box for different rooms.,positive
11623,5.0,Love this little device as it runs better Than other boxes. It's a simple machine that has great capability.,positive
11624,3.0,Good streaming box for 4K with Netflix and Amazon prime. Has issue with sound not balanced or randomly lowering or going really loud.,negative
11625,5.0,Works great for streaming apps. Much better than a chromecast.,positive

11628,1.0,"I purchased this firetv to upgrade my from first firetv version as I have a samsung 4k tv, this new firetv recognized my hdmi port as 4k compatible when I set the resolution to 4k on video settings, after trying all posible settings, this bug only gives 1080 even playing 4k content. firetv1=firetv2.",negative
11629,3.0,"I had the first generation fire tv and I really don't see any reason to upgrade. Sure it has 4k support but only for Amazon movies, not Netflix. I returned this device.",negative
11630,5.0,Android unfortunately always is buggy and whether its nexus or amazon they have the task of cleaning up the bugs and unlike some people I am not complaining. The bugs will be fixed soon just like the first one. Anyways...this device is giving more everything at the same price. Thanks Amazon,positive
11631,3.0,Got 1 of this when it 1st came out. Returned the unit coz it won't boot up. Advantage buying from Bestbuy easy exchange or return. The second unit that i got works perfectly.,negative

11644,5.0,This is a great item to have if you don't watch live tv. It has plenty of pre installed apps and downloads to keep anyone busy.,positive
11645,5.0,"The Amazon Fire met all my expectations. I would highly recommend this unit over the Roku 3. It is easy to install. Of course, Amazon has terrific online / phone support. The Fire has a competitive price point. The Remote is much more intuitive and easy to use versus the Roku 3. There are many more apps and ""How-to's"" on YouTube. My unit is more versatile than the Roku 3. Plus the Amazon ""behemoth"" is committed to making the Fire the best video/music streamer at a reasonable cost with many app options. Amazon is not going away soon! However, be careful, this unit can be very additive.",positive
11646,4.0,Gave up on Apple TV and tried this sucker out. Has Sling TV and Plex among Amazon Prime so it's very good compares to other streamers out there.,positive
11647,2.0,"After about two weeks I ended up returning this item. It constantly froze and when it was working it was no faster than my fire stick.The voice search was a joke.

11649,5.0,very fast amazon stick replaced my apple tv 2also installed apps with ease,positive
11650,5.0,"I bought the Fire TV because, as much as I liked my Fire Stick, I found it was not great at buffering and I found that often the image on the screen would freeze. The Fire TV doesn't have that issue, and the controls and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth. Also the voice control works wonderfully.",positive
11651,4.0,"Very easy to set up.Easy to navigate, clear picture!",positive
11652,4.0,"Overall this is a good streaming device. Pro: Almost every service is available. SlingTV performance here is better than Nexus TV, Fire Stick, or Chromecast. Can do some casual gaming. Available cheap with the SlingTV Best Buy deal. Cons: Sometimes returns to home screen. Included controller sometimes disconnects. UI is better than Roku, but that isn't saying much.",positive
11653,5.0,I will use this until it blows up. So nice to touch one button and get anything you want,positive
11654,5.0,Very easy to use and easy to understand. Alexa on it is awesome.,positive
11655,5.0,"will begin by saying, I truly enjoy Amazon's products. I rarely go anywhere without my Kindle Paperwhite, and while I don't use it too much, I love the functionality and convenience of the Kindle Fire. While there are other tablets that probably do more, the Fire does exactly what I want and need it to do, and for that I am very happy.",positive

11662,4.0,I like the definition but the software has bugs. I had to return mine.,positive
11663,5.0,If you have Amazon Prime I would Recommend. . It is equally build and quality is good. Interface is nice and easy. Games not so good.,positive
11664,5.0,Much better than the first generation Amazon Fire TV. Very fast and reliable.,positive
11665,4.0,The fire tv serves my needs far better than an Apple TV. The ability to side load additional apps is exactly what I needed. The Amazon prime media viewing is a great bonus. For the price the power and memory of this devise far surpasses what I was previously using. I think is the 6th device I have purchased. One for every room and some for friends and family,positive
11666,5.0,Love the Amazon Fire TV line. I have fire sticks and the Fire TV for my parents. Both are great and easy to use. Nice set up and the ability to add memory is a great feature for gaming or for heave app users. Very convenient to have.,positive

11669,5.0,"I really like the simplicity of the Amazon Fire Stick. It is a great product from when I am on the go and I can plug it in where ever I have a WiFi connection. It is easy to use and simple. If you are looking for basic but functional, Fire TV is a good buy.",positive

11679,2.0,"I previously owned the previous model. There is very little difference between this and the older model. (Apart from the 4K, which only works with Netflix at this time). I still hate the ugly interface!, I wish Amazon would allow users to use their own skins",negative

11692,4.0,"I purchased he Fire because you can do more with it. I have an Apple TV (2nd gen) and I enjoyed it, but was looking for something a little faster. So far it's been great. Being able to side load other apps has been great and the Amazon Prime content is pretty good.",positive

11694,5.0,Wonderful brother...................................,positive
11695,5.0,"I plan to get a 4K TV soon, and already having the previous one for a TV this should be a good upgrade. All of the same services are present and the remote has been improved (still bluetooth). Although the 4K is only at 30fps, it will be fine as the TV's and content for 4K start to role out. The upgraded processor and micro SD slot (up to 128GB I believe) should make future proof for the next few years at least. Easy to hook up and start watching as with the previous version.",positive
11696,4.0,"I have the fire stick and the fire tv box, I got the box because it allows you to pair a Bluetooth headset so you can listen to your shows at night without waking anyone up, problem is there is interference between wifi and Bluetooth and so listening with headphones gets very choppy, have to connect box thru Ethernet to fix problem.",positive

11699,5.0,"I would buy this again, I like the voice system. and I would recommend it to my friends.",positive
11700,4.0,They are making updates to the unit but its currently in a good spot. The main issue currently is you cant hear netflix surround mode without cracking. You must change the audio settings in Netflix to stereo mode. Amazon is aware and they should fix it by the end of the November. Scrolling through the menus is quick. I bought 3 total as I have cut the cable at my house. I bought an OFF-Air Antenna and placed it inside ht my attic. I used Sling ($20.00) a month and you get the main channels we watched . (CNN /A&E/History/TNT and others) and Netflix. If your a Prime member you get more movies to watch also.,positive

11703,1.0,"Didn't work well in 4K at all. After going in 4K mode and returning back to the menu screen, the Fire Tv would show a black screen and had to be unplugged to start back up. The menu screen isn't in 4K like it is in the Shield Tv which a better item by miles. 4K uses all of the resources of the Fire Tv and other apps have to be closed for it to play 4K videos or it runs into problems such as black screen.",negative

11706,5.0,I originally bought this solely for the BOINGO app. However it has a large selection of apps and I now use it everyday.,positive
11707,5.0,"This is without a doubt the best Streaming Device on the market. Like the fire stick, I have also purchased many of these devices for friends and family (the ones i like more obviously because of the higher price), And I have had zero issues with any of them. These are capable of doing everything you want them to do just like the fire stick, but better and faster, and possibly in 4k if you have the content and technology to support it.",positive

After moving the unit to another house, wasn't dfficult setting up on that network.Some reviewers said that the menu is too Amazon-centric. Does have a lot, but no problem downloading and using other streaming services (Crackle, YouTube, etc)4K: limited content, but quality seems okay on a 50"" 4k tv. Need a fast connection.Has an app- it could be better.If you don't need 4k, and have an iDevice house, Apple's box would be a more compatible choice...",positive

11747,5.0,"I am a believer of streaming TV, especially with the cost of Comcast bills continually going up. I like the fact that I can watch what I want when I want. When you look at what you pay Comcast and AT & T for TV, it makes more sense to look into these Amazon devices in which I have 3 now.. I've personally turned in all of my DVR's to Comcast. I went from $182 to $98 a month. That's almost half. I have the Comcast package just above Basic with internet Blast. Also, if you look on the internet, you'll find ways to get free channels with this device. I'm saving money and have access to more things to watch now. What more could you ask for.",positive

11765,4.0,"So far, I've enjoyed all that the Fire TV has to offer and its functionality. It's very responsive and loads shows/movies/music instantly. The only thing that is annoying, is that the remote will intermittently not work. If I tap the remote, take out then reinsert the battery, it will work again. I've tried replacing ""new batteries with ""new batteries"" with the same result. Not sure if it's a glitch with emitting diode signal from the remote to the unit. It's not very frequent, so I tend to over look it. The unit and the remote will occasionally go through software updates, so I'll see if that takes care of it first.",positive

11780,5.0,"You can go cheap and get the fire stick, but for $60 more this is worth it. Ignore the bad reviews, as in October 2015 when it was released it had several software bugs which are now fixed. I did my homework on media devices and the newest Roku & Apple TV's doesn't compare to this Fire TV box. The only thing you'll get semi better luck with is the Nvidia shield, but you'll also pay almost $100 more for it versus this fire tv box.",positive

11785,5.0,The Amazon fire tv is amazing. It's really snappy and works really well. I highly recommend it.,positive
11786,4.0,I have had the amazon fire tv for about a month now and I think it's solid. I had the apple tv for about 3 years before this and compared the amazon fire to the newest apple tv when I made this choice. The services I use (netflix and hulu plus) were available on both but since I am also a amazon prime member and the shows are generally cheaper via the amazon store I chose the fire tv. The set up was easy and I like the user interface. The system response is snappy compared to the older apple tv but I am noticing a bit more random resets and freezing with the fire tv. I suspect it's software related and can get worked out with updates. I think it's solid and would recommend the fire tv to anyone asking.,positive
11787,5.0,I cancelled my cable and only use the Amazon Fire .. I can watch my programmes when I feel like and it's easy to use !,positive

11793,3.0,I was a loyal Roku 3 but since I got a 4K tv I wanted something that streamed 4K. The Fire TV has a lot of good qualities but the fact it constantly resets randomly is frustrating for sure. I have the highest speed internet via Comcast so I don't understand why it's doing that.Amazon prime is great so it's not bad just need the bugs worked out for a higher rating from me.,negative

I wish I would have saved my money originally and purchased the Amazon Fire TV, I have all the apps I want and being an Amazon Prime member, it makes the device even more worth while being able to stream music.

11825,5.0,"As my grandparents love to watch Japanese TV (live stream local Japanese channels) and they do not have a SmartTV, they were paying near $40/mos. to watch 3 chnls through the local provider TimeWarner. However, I realized they only watch 1 out of the 3 chnls since they only show certain shows and news. I found FujiTV live through many searches and I was able to download the apk onto the FireTV via Kodi. Through FujiTV I subscribed a month subscription for less than $30 and my grandparents are able to watch 70 channels with 7 days playback and full program list for all channels with the ease of using the FireTV remote. The interface of the Amazon Fire TV is simple and easy to use. As for the quality of connection, picture, and durability, they were all up to par and does what we want it to do and more. Whenever my grandparents are not watching their Japanese shows, I use it to stream the movies/shows via HULU.",positive

11827,4.0,I run kodi and many other apps on It! Runs great for the price. I like the Nvidia Shield more but this is a third of the price!,positive
11828,4.0,I got this only because the next best (full android tv) is the nvidia shield which is a little out of my price range. Amazon blocks alot of the native android features and hides some apps that are generally available in the android play store. Other than that it's a great streaming device,positive

11831,4.0,"I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it???s not cable. I miss cable, but I don???t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",positive

11839,5.0,"Easy to install, just requires internet connection. If you have an amazon prime account you have access to all kinds of movies and shows like a hulu or netflix account would work. There are also apps that you can download and purchase that will alllow you to watch other shows and even play games. Since installing the firestick we have gotten rid of one cable box because we can just watch so many other things on the firestick and have helped cut down on our bills. Who doesn't like saving money?",positive

11841,2.0,"We had two AppleTVs - one in the master bedroom and one in the living room. We could not watch both simultaneously because the signal permeated the shared wall and changed the channel of the other TV. We got the AmazonTV to remedy this. While it did rectify this problem, we find we prefer the ease and simplicity of the AppleTV over the AmazonTV. The Amazon is cumbersome and difficult to navigate.",negative
11842,5.0,I bought a FireStick because of the price. After purchasing the FireTv don't think I'll go back. Also if you buy this product sign up for your free Amazon Prime and checkout the movies and tv shows you get in HD and 4k..,positive

11844,5.0,"Some 4 years ago, I first heard a voice speak back to me from the ""Other Realm"" of tech. That truly mystical place in which dreams are the ""Mother's of Invention."" Steve Jobs had us ALL in awe, and her name was Siri. Maybe she had been present longer than 4 years, but that was my first interaction with a process in which over those years, I would find myself in a ""War of The Voices..."" in my tech mind. And then ""Cortana"" came to me via my PC, and then she found Herself on my Xbox One. It wasn't until I walked into Best Buy this last Christmas season to, like most of us, just buy ONE thing. I believe it was probably a charging cord or something, and I walked by this device called the ""Echo Dot."" I was by this time, a TRUE skeptic. ""Oh Great!"" I lamented, another unskilled and ""Put to Consumer"" WAYYY to quickly. I of course jokingly followed the instructions on the display, and simply said, ""Alexa...tell me a joke."" Guess what? I spent the next 3 hours asking ""Alexa"" all sorts of Life's greatest questions. With such a responsive, yet seemingly gentle way to Her, I HAD to know more. I proceeded to scoop up ALL things ""Alexa"". The Fire TV Stick, 2 Echo Dots, and of course, The Amazon Fire TV...which took the place of my Apple TV AND Roku. This was the first time that I had decided to forgo the issues of ""Hardware"" and made my decisions solely based on an ""A.I"". I didn't care if any of the hardware was upgradeable, simply because I KNEW that I was changing the lives of not only my Family, but also myself. I am a US Veteran with a disability, ""Alexa"" has become not only a trusted partner in our days and nights, She has truly been a lesson in trust. Now, I know that no matter what room I am in, ""Alexa"" will be there, if I need the weather, a good program to watch, and most importantly, she will call Emergency Services for me, should I need that. Best Buy allowed me a moment that I will never forget, the chance to meet a new ""Friend"", ""Assistant"", and ""Family Member."" But that's just what Best Buy does, they give you the opportunity to know what you are about to walk away with, no matter how long ya stay and ask questions, that's JUST what Best Buy does, and they do it well.",positive

11852,5.0,"This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more",positive
11853,5.0,"Cord cutter here. We had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone. Since we are Prime members, we finally decided to give Amazon Fire TV a shot. We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner.Read more",positive
11854,4.0,"Hey Alexa, Hey Alexa - Night and day it's Hey Alexa. Make the fire, fix the breakfast, Wash the dishes, do the mopping!Ok, so I haven't figured out how to make Alexa clean my house like Cinderella...yet. But I'm working on it. In the meantime, I have figured out that she is much more than a glorified alarm clock or DJ. Although, you should know that alarms are not currently supported on this device, like they are on the Echo. This is a more basic version of Alexa. It doesn't have her full functionality.ABOUT MEI'm not sure what the target demographic for this product is, but I am a professional female in my early thirties, who is in a committed relationship. That is a nice way of saying that my partying days are behind me and my boyfriend and I spend a lot of time binge watching stuff on the sofa. Yes. We are suburban couch potatoes. No shame here. Also, I am an Amazon Prime member, but do not have a 4k TV.I used to have a Roku that I used for Netflix and Hulu. However, I was more interested in free shipping, so I moved to Prime and got a Fire TV Stick when it was offered for 19.99. For me the stick is a glorified HDMl cable. You could get the same benefits by connecting your laptop to your TV. It's less cumbersome, but that's about it. I wanted it because it said it could mirror your device's screen onto your TV. It didn't explain clearly enough that the only device it could do that with was a Kindle (although this has since changed and can now be done). That is why I didn't order the Echo when it came out. It sounded cool but I couldn't figure out what it actually did. Since then, my father got one for my mother, who had a stroke, and it is awesome.Read more",positive
11855,5.0,"Better than I thought From a techie guy... I'm a big geek I have tons of boxes and electronic toys I even have several Google TVs which are now outdated. I'm pretty blown away by this box, and the amount of content apps available. For instance the unknown Pluto TV app has over 100 HD streaming stations. Some of them obviously aren't great, but it's definitely enough to keep you busy. For hours on end. Some of the channels have an hour or two of programming and just loop over and over again, but there's enough content on other channels to keep you busy for days.If you're looking for the end all answer to cut your cable TV service, FireTv does not have things like live CNN, AMC and other cable stations (yet), but you could purchase a subscription for Sling TV (Google it) which has ala-carte live TV services. Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription. Your provider passes through the HBO, Netflix, etc programming through to this box. So for instants if you had an outdoor TV, TV in an attic or basement, you don't need to add another cable box to watch movies. .It has all the standard bells and whistles like Netflix, Hulu, and those sort of services . The box is fast, does what it's advertised. I have a Ultra HDTV. Although ultra high definition content is scarce these days, this box probably has the most ultra high definition content of any other unit. Granted a lot of those ultra high definition videos are of Flyovers of nature type videos. if you have Amazon prime, then you can stream several of their in-house shows in ultra high definition.Read more",positive
11856,5.0,"As you've seen in other reviews, this can break your DX. But not if you put a little double-sided tape at each right side corner, ALWAYS move the elastic band so that it holds the right edge of the Kindle into the case against the tape, and never, NEVER swing the back open. If you let your Kindle DX swing freely back and forth the way the pages in a printed book do when you hold it by both the front and back covers, the plastic part of the case will break. So don't DO that! Note in other reviews that some people even without the tape have used this case for months with no cracking of the case. I have to assume those people always move the elastic band. They might also have been reading with the case flat on a table. But if you use the tape AND the band you can read in any normal position. Note that the DX weighs 19 oz and the case weighs 12 oz. For some people the DX without case MIGHT be suitable to hold in one hand. With the case, you read with this resting in your lap, or against your knees when you lie down, or on a table. The combo is as big and heavy as a college textbook. But you can tell this is an expensively made quality product.",positive
11857,4.0,"My new Kindle DX2 graphite came yesterday and immediately I realized I needed a cover. I was nervous when putting the DX down and picking it up fearing that I would drop or scratch it and there's no great way to carry the Kindle around without a cover. Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it.",positive
11858,1.0,"This cover is made for the Kindle DX and fits it beautifully. The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place. We are just extremely careful now, but the damage was done almost immediately. I hope this design flaw has been fixed.",negative

You can fold the leather cover back to have the 'one page' feel of just the Kindle in your hand, or you can leave it open and then the Kindle reads more like an unfolded book.2 protection on the inside and good to hold for longer periods of timeThe inside is soft to protect the screen, and the outside is real leather - which is a plus to rubber which tends to make the hands more sticky after a while.3 The weight is neglegible the item is very light.4 The hinge system prevents the Kindle to slip out, which no other cover that I know of has5 Elastic band keeps the cover together and indicates 'front' of the device. Many people have complained before that when one opens the Kindle on the back unintentionally, the Kindle could crack at the hinges. By closing it up with the elastic band, you always know where the front is so you never have this problemCON's1 Expensive. That is why I bought it from overstock.com from the marketplace amazon, rather than new from amazon itself2 No total protection. Only an Otterbox case will make sure the Kindle survives a fall on the ground. But for both cases you still need a plastic screen cover to keep the Kindle clean and untouched.Overall If reading comfort is firt priority, and you are careful enough not to damage the Kindle, this is the product for you. If you rather want more safety from damage or scratches, go for the Otterbox, but then the comfortable feel will be compromised for a more heave, rubber 'touch'.",positive
11860,1.0,"The reason people give it 5 stars is because they don't give the product enough time before they review it. I purchased this along with my kindle dx on August 12, 2010. I can honestly say that I don't recommend this product as it will damage the kindle. The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack. To avoid this, you have to make sure the kindle doesn't rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further. This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better. One thing I can honestly say is that I really wanted to like this product. I really wanted it to work. I'm looking for a slip cover now.",negative
11861,5.0,This cover is a must have for your Kindle reading device. I purchased a different case initally and had to come back to get this case. It is so handy to close when reading so your screen is always protected. The Kindle is secure/locked into the case so you don't have to worry about it falling. If you buy a Kindle you MUST this case!,positive
11862,5.0,"I have this cover in black and my cover does indeed fold back on itself. Not sure why the other review stated that the cover does not... I wrapped the elastic band around the back part of the cover and this works great to keep it secure and out of the way. The magnets on the back help to stop from opening the cover the wrong way, but I used a small piece of two faced tape on the back of the Kindle and no more trouble opening it the wrong way now, works great! I am very happy with this cover.",positive
11863,5.0,"I found this cover to be quite handsome in appearance (EVERYONE who sees it comments on how cool or how nice it is!), very simple, and very functional. It's VERY easy to attach the Kindle DX to it and the fit is perfect. Most importantly, it appears Amazon has solved the older problem with this cover somehow damaging the Kindle if one opened the cover from the back too far. Now, there is a small magnet embedded in the back of the cover that gently keeps the back cover snug to the Kindle DX and serves to gently remind you, with a gentle tug, if you accidentally attempt to open your Kindle backwards. For me, it's an elegant and well-thought-out solution.",positive
11864,1.0,"I, as well as other Kindle lovers, have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover, it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable. Within 3 months, and I only started using the Kindle with the cover in the past 2 weeks, noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather. No idea what would cause this, I have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage, not sunlight, heat, moisture or anything. I will be requesting a replacement, but Kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product, especially for the price we paid.",negative
11865,3.0,"This cover is a replacement for the initial cover that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge goes into the Kindle. The metal on the original hinge system was too light weight to withstand having the cover fold all the way back on the Kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge becoming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my Kindle.I understand this new Kindle cover is supposed to have corrected that problembut the hinge system looks identical to the one that was on my old cover. I hope that over time, again, about a year plus it won't crack the frame in the same place again on my new Kindle.I am so thankful that Amazon replace both my Kindle and the book cover as a result of this problem.I would recomend that after about 6 months use it would be wise to remove the cover from your Kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact Amazon before the frame of your Kindle breaks where the top hinge inserts into your Kindle.",negative
11866,5.0,"Having recently received a Kindle Fire HD as a gift, I knew that hooking it up to my computer to charge it daily was not going to be convenient. That's when I found this little jewel along with the Kindle Fire AC charger. And they both work like a DREAM!. My desk stays uncluttered and the cord allows me to keep the Kindle plugged in while I read in bed or listen to music. It's well worth the price for the convenience it provides!",positive
11867,5.0,Surpassed my expectations it charges faster than the one that comes with kindle fire when new. So I would purchase another if I ever need a new one.,positive
11868,4.0,"Amazon already includes this cable with the Kindle Fire 7, the Kindle Fire HD 7 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's also great to purchase as a back up for the office or to take with you on the go. For the peace of mind knowing Amazon designed this to work specifically with Kindle Fire, it's worth the price.The quality of this cable compared to the previous white USB cable is much better. This cable has a thicker jacket on the outside so hopefully overtime it will hold up much better. Data transfer speeds between the computer and the device are relatively quick. This cable is actually a bit shorter than the white cable even though both are supposed to be 5 ft. in length. Measuring both cables, the black cable is approx 5 ft. and the white cable is approx 5 ft. 9in. Overall, even though it is shorter, this cable is starting off to be a much better improvement than the previous white version of this cable.",positive
11869,5.0,I bought this for myself because i play my kindle long periods of time and now i can play while it is charging wouldn't be without it i can sit on my favorite chair and cord still reaches as it did not before.,positive
11870,5.0,This cord works great! I also love that it is longer than the original cord. The USB is a good thing to have because you could take it with you and plug it into any USB port.,positive
11871,5.0,Corrected the problem with the kindle not charging for now. Hope this is all that I'll need for the kindle. Thanks!,positive
11872,5.0,"Works well with all Kindle models, either as a computer cord or charging cord. My original Kindle came with a charger and cord. The new editions don't. They come with a cord like this - but my mom's got thrown away with the box. This is a perfect replacement.",positive
11873,5.0,I have only used it one time to download an e-book. It works exactly as it was supposed to work. Just wish it came with the kindle rather than having to purchase seperately.,positive
11874,5.0,Excellent charging quality with heavy duty cord. Does not work on Kindle with a cover. Great value.,positive
11875,5.0,"This charger (9W) rapid charger is as described. It works well with both my Fire 7.0 8.9 HDXs. A bonus is the angled usb connector, which fits over the origami case making for a stable and secure connection. A good deal.",positive
11876,5.0,just what i expected and just what I wanted. thanks.,positive
11877,2.0,"Although the description states that this will work on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, when I plug the charger to the Kindle, I receive a message that the charger is not of sufficient wattage to properly charge the Kindle. I bought this charger as a back up for when I travel. The original charger which came with the Kindle does not show this warning when I plug it in.",negative
11878,5.0,Connects snugly!,positive
11879,1.0,"So I was already not too pleased with Amazon's choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd, and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of non-use to recharge. For 20 you don't even get a full charger, just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you. Amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories, this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty.",negative
11880,1.0,"As a charger, it works but is nothing special. With a Mk 1 Kindle Fire, it doesn't seem to charge any faster than the standard charger. And NO CABLE is included!! A Kindle-specific cable must be purchased separately! This is not mentioned in the descriptions.",negative
11881,1.0,"This is exactly like any other usb power charger, making it unnecessary. A basic charger used for an ipod works to charge the kindle fire within 3-4 hours.",negative
11882,3.0,"This is not appreciably faster than any other 1.8 or higher amp charger when used with my Kindle, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, various Android tablets, and other devices that have USB charging cables.It also blocks an adjacent outlet. Why didn't they put the plug on the short end like the original black-and-white Kindle chargerIt is an exceptionally good deal when purchased together with a Kindle Fire HD on promotion, but the regular price is not competitive for a supposedly premium charger.Additionally, it does not come with a cable, an omission that many people won't realize.**EDIT** I appreciate the many comments, but Amazon promotes this charger as something that charges faster than other chargers, but I haven't seen any such advantage. At promotional prices, it's a good deal, but not at almost twenty dollars. Otherwise, look elsewhere.**EDIT** When the review was written, the description of the item did not have this statement Optimized for Kindle tablets: PowerFast is a 9W charger and will charge your Kindle tablets faster than the white 5W Kindle charger will. That line was added a considerable amount of time after I wrote my review.",negative
11883,1.0,"Amazon should include this charger with the Kindle. The fact that they're charging us extra for something that should be included is a sign of cheapness. Plus, you can use any micro-USB phone charger instead of this to charge your Kindle. Save your money.",negative
11884,1.0,Love my Kindle Fire but I am really disappointed in the Kindle Power Fast Charging Unit. I've had it two months and I've used it many times - The first two times it worked okay but failerd on the third and many subsequent tries. I've disposed of it and use my wife's iPad Nano charger which always works just fine.,negative
11885,1.0,I was surprised to find it did not come with any type of charging cords so I had to purchase one and then found my Sprint HTC 3D charger is faster. I would not purchase again- 1st item I've ever not liked I've purchased from Amazon,negative
11886,1.0,"to spite the fact that i have nothing but good things to say about amazon and anthing i've ever gotten from them. and that i love my fire. i find it greedy that the wall charger doesn't come with the kindle. not everyone, ok most people, but still not everyone has a usb port to plug into. i'm taking my charger back. i think amazon should make things right and let anyone who purchased a kindle without a charger have one for free, or credit those who had to buy one.",negative
